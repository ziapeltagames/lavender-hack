# Lavender Hack

Welcome to _Lavender Hack_ (_LHC_)! _Lavender Hack_ is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game with a focus on abstract but **strict time records**, exploration, community building, trade, and downtime. In many places, it works like [_B/X_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) style games, but it has some newer ideas, such as success with cost and tighter procedures to support different modes of play.

### Blather

Hi! I'm Phil Lewis. I wrote much of the text and designed a few new widgets, but most of it is heavily inspired by other games. The big influences are [_Whitehack_](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/), [_Black Hack_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition), [_Macchiato Monsters_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264169/Macchiato-Monsters), [_Dungeon Crawl Classics_](http://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/), _Czege House Rules_, [_Knave_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave), _Dreams of Adventure_, [_The One Ring_](http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/the-one-ring/), [_Ironsworn_](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/), [_Torchbearer_](https://www.torchbearerrpg.com/), [_Dungeon World_](https://dungeon-world.com/), [_Advanced Dungeons & Dragons_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17003/Players-Handbook-1e), and [_Old School Essentials_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/272802/OldSchool-Essentials-Basic-Rules). I'm going to use these **Blather** sections to rant and ramble and add more context. Skip them if you're just looking for rules.

**"Strict Time Records"** is a Gygaxian reference to the first edition [_Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17004/Dungeon-Masters-Guide-1e) beseeching Dungeon Masters to use time pressure effectively. Way back in the mid 1980s, I found this idea fun in theory, but cumbersome in practice. One of the core goals of this system is to make time pressure central to the game while keeping the fiddly bits manageable and meaningful. That's kind of my jam. I wrote another game called [_Wrath of the Autarch_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/191025/Wrath-of-the-Autarch) which is fun if you want a really deep dive on domain management.

There is also a goal to hew close to a [_B/X_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) core so I can use OSR content like [_Barrowmaze_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/139762/Barrowmaze-Complete) or [_Hot Springs Island_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/215340/The-Dark-of-Hot-Springs-Island) or [_Night's Dark Terror_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17119/B10-Nights-Dark-Terror-Basic) or [_Dwimmermount_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/133746/Dwimmermount-Labyrinth-Lord-version) without too much pain. _Torchbearer_ and _The One Ring_ both manage time in interesting ways, but aren't close enough to B/X to make that content very easy to use. That said, those two are among my favorite RPGs, so if you haven't played them, you should!

This game itself probably doesn't fit into the [OSR](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/1144/what-defines-the-old-school-renaissance), but you can still use B/X to cover up any holes in the rules (of which there are currently many), and you'll be in pretty good shape. It also might go without saying, but you need to understand tabletop role-playing games and _B/X_ and even newer games like _Dungeon World_ to make sense of this. There's a lot left unspoken. If you're completely new, get started with _5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons_ and come back after you've played a few games.

# Format

The game is currently represented in a set of markdown files. Markdown is a text format which can be rendered to look pretty by various stand-alone software and browser plug-ins (as well as here on github). Using github and markdown is nice because github preserves detailed version history while markdown is simple, text based, and gets out of the way when doing early design work. You can also do stuff like manage tasks and issues in github. It's mainly a software development tool, but any sort of text works fine.

If some section isn't correct or an area could use work, feel free to raise an issue! You can also copy all the content in a fork and make your own hack of this hack. Just respect the terms of the OGL.

There is a _very_ crude character sheet located [here](sheets/CHARACTER_SHEET.md) and a _very_ crude party sheet located [here](sheets/PARTY_SHEET.md). They're basically just lists of things in the game.
