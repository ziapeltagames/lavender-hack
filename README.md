# Lavender Hack

Welcome to _Lavender Hack_ (_LHC_)! _Lavender Hack_ is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game with a focus on abstract but **strict time records**, **exploration**, **diplomacy**, **trade**, and **downtime**. In many places, it works like [_B/X_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) style games, but it has some newer ideas, such as success with cost, a player facing resolution system that minimizes "nothing happens" results, and tighter procedures to support different modes of play.

## xml

Contains tagged InDesign exports, updated erratically. I'd love to have a solution where I can modify the xml and import it directly, but I've had lots of issues with imports and whitespace. It probably requires some significant XSLT mastery to work seamlessly, and I haven't devoted the time.

## txt

Contains text InDesign exports, updated erratically.

# Roadmap

The current plan is to release a free beta PDF on drivethrurpg when all of the content is finished. That's probably close to happening, perhaps by January 2020. Then there will be lots of playtesting, editing, and adding additional content prior to a printed release later in 2020.
