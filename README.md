# Lavender Hack

Welcome to _Lavender Hack_ (_LHC_)! _Lavender Hack_ is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game with a focus on abstract but **strict time records**, **exploration**, **diplomacy**, **trade**, and **downtime**. In many places, it works like [_B/X_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) style games, but it has some newer ideas, such as success with cost, a player facing resolution system that minimizes "nothing happens" results, and tighter procedures to support different modes of play.

The raw markdown text for this effort is no longer around, having been merged into InDesign for layout. There is an ICML file in this repository that contains the text, but the draft PDF will be placed on ZiapeltaGames.com shortly.
