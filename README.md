# Strict Time Records

This repository holds the text for _Strict Time Records_, a role-playing game inspired by _Whitehack_, _Black Hack_, _Macchiato Monsters_, _Dungeon Crawl Classics_, _Czege House Rules_, _Knave_, _Dreams of Adventure_, _Dungeon World_, and _Old School Essentials_.

The goal is to capture the spirit of B/X D&D as much as possible, while using a few bells and whistles from newer games. Toward that end, rolling a d20 for most tasks (where 20 is the best result), using the standard six attributes, and having a class based system are used as a base. The game deviates from B/X with a player facing resolution system, along with abstract but tightly integrated resource management.

# Format

The game is currently in one large markdown file, located [here](RULES.md). Markdown is a text format which can be rendered to look pretty by various stand-alone software and browser plug-ins (as well as here on github). Using github and markdown is nice because github preserves detailed version history while markdown is simple, text based, and gets out of the way when doing early design work.

There is a _very_ crude character sheet located [here](CHARACTER_SHEET.md) and a _very_ crude party sheet located [here](PARTY_SHEET.md).

# Contributions

I'm not looking for help on the core rules, but I'm happy to accept help with class features, spells, abilities, monsters, and magical itemry.
