# Lavender Hack

This repository holds the text for _Lavender Hack_, a role-playing game inspired by _Whitehack_, _Black Hack_, _Macchiato Monsters_, _Dungeon Crawl Classics_, _Czege House Rules_, _Knave_, _Dreams of Adventure_, _Dungeon World_, _Old School Essentials_, and the **strict time records** aesthetic of _Advanced Dungeons and Dragons First Edition_.

The goal is to capture the spirit of [B/X](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) as much as possible, while using a few bells and whistles from newer games. Toward that end, a d20 is rolled during interesting situations (where 20 is the best result), using modifiers from the standard six B/X attributes. A class based system is used as a base. The game deviates from B/X with a single player facing resolution system which includes success with cost, along with abstract but tightly integrated resource management.

# Format

The game is currently in one large markdown file, located [here](RULES.md). Markdown is a text format which can be rendered to look pretty by various stand-alone software and browser plug-ins (as well as here on github). Using github and markdown is nice because github preserves detailed version history while markdown is simple, text based, and gets out of the way when doing early design work.

There is a _very_ crude character sheet located [here](CHARACTER_SHEET.md) and a _very_ crude party sheet located [here](PARTY_SHEET.md). They're basically just lists of things in the game.
