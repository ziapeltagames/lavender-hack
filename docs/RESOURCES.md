# Resources

An important part _Lavender Hack_ is managing the four core resources represented by usage dice: food, fellowship, gear, and light. These dice step up and down based on the activities of players.

# Gear

As mentioned earlier, most common adventuring gear is abstracted out into the gear die. It is assumed characters have standard sorts of gear, such as appropriate clothing, tents, bedrolls, flint and steel, sacks, backpacks, rope, parchment, iron spikes, and class related items like repair kits, lockpicks, spellbooks, and spell reagents.

If the players want gear that is more odd, like a shrimp net or an hourglass, they may produce it, but must roll the gear die. Very specific things which may pertain to mission goals, like a unicorn horn, or magic items, like a balm of healing, can't be produced with the gear die. Also, gear produced this way can't be transferred to a character sheet. You can't use the gear die as an item generator for trade!

## Gear Save

The spotlight player makes a **gear save** when a d20 gear die is rolled.

* Critical: Improvised gear. Value is 4 and step up the gear die to a d4.
* Strong: Value is 4.
* Weak: Value is 3.
* Miss: Failed! Value is 0 and roll fellowship.
* Fumble: Catastrophe! Value is 0 and character in party using gear takes their hit die in damage.

# Food and Light

Food and light are tracked separately from other adventuring gear. They are heavily used in the [Exploration](EXPLORATION.md) section.

## Food Save

The spotlight player makes a **food save** when a d20 food die is rolled.

* Critical: Crafty foraging. Value is 4 and step up the food die to a d4.
* Strong: Value is 4.
* Weak: Value is 3.
* Miss: Going hungry. Value is 0 and roll fellowship.
* Fumble: Starving. Value is 0, roll fellowship, and any tests involving Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution are rolled with disadvantage until the food die is stepped up.

## Light Save

The spotlight player makes a **light save** when a d20 light die is rolled.

* Critical: Improvised torches. Value is 4 and step up the light die to a d4.
* Strong: Value is 4.
* Weak: Value is 3.
* Miss: Darkness. Value is 0 and roll fellowship. Any tests needing light are rolled with disadvantage.
* Fumble: Grue fodder. Value is 0, roll fellowship, and roll an encounter. The characters are in darkness. Any tests needing light are rolled with disadvantage. Furthermore, a random encounter occurs at this inopportune time. Hopefully the encountered group uses light sources!

# Fellowship

Fellowship is considered a resource, although it is a very different sort of resource than gear, food, and water. Fellowship represents how well the group is getting along together. As hardships increase, fellowship tends to step down. It is very important during [Court](COURT.md).

## Fellowship Save

The spotlight player makes a **fellowship save** when a d20 fellowship die is rolled.

* Critical: Growing through adversity. Value is 4 and step up the fellowship die to a d4.
* Strong: Value is 4.
* Weak: Value is 3.
* Miss: Simmering hatred. Value is 0 and one character leaves the party for d20 weeks. Roll up a new one to take their place. As usual, the spotlight player decides in the case of a disagreement.
* Fumble: 0. Death and Mayhem! Value is 0 and one character is murdered in their sleep. If the players can't decide who is the murderer and who is the murdered, the spotlight player decides.
