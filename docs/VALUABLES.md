# Valuables

_Lavender Hack_ uses an abstract concept of **value**. Valuables are sorted into ten broad value categories, each of exponential worth. _LHC_ uses a copper penny standard for currency, when there is currency, which isn't often. Instead, value tends to be very relative to different cultures the players encounter. A big part of _LHC_ is discovering and trading with different groups. The value in terms of copper pennies is only provided as a rough guideline. Occasionally it is necessary to compare a usage die to this scale, which is also given in the table below.

| Value | Usage Die | Copper Pennies | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | d20 | 1 | Moldy Potato |
| 2 | d4 | 5 | Bushel of Grain |
| 3 | d6 | 25 | Small Bell |
| 4 | d8 | 125 | Shield |
| 5 | d10 | 625 | Longsword |
| 6 | d12 | 3,000 | Half Plate |
| 7 | - | 15,000 | Full Plate |
| 8 | - | 80,000 | Stone Tower |
| 9 | - | 400,000 | Warship |
| 10 | - | 2,000,000 | Stronghold |

Valuables are described by a **type**, a **value**, and the number of **slots** required to carry it. Valuables are things like treasure, jewels, maps, scrolls, and clothing. But also unique types of equipment like weapons or armor which aren't covered by the gear die. Weapons and armor are further described by how much damage they do or how much protection they afford.

The type of a valuable is a general class, such as clothing, art, armor, jewelry, potion, animal, or plant. It is used when trading with factions, as they may favor certain types of valuables over others.

### Blather

The general exchange rate is 5:1 across each row of the value table. This mainly comes into play during [_Downtime_](DOWNTIME.md). It typically takes five things of one value to make something of the next higher value. Making change is less efficient, at 1:4. _Lavender Hack_ reflects a world where currency exchange is a questionable proposition at best.

## Slots

Characters start the game with a number of slots equal to 5 + Str modifier. Most all items take one slot each. This isn't many slots, but it's assumed the character is carrying lots of other things not on their character sheet. Those things are represented by the gear, food, and light usage dice.

## Coins, Weight, and Slots

It takes roughly 100 coins or 10 pounds to occupy one slot. This also holds true for other lighter things like a piece of paper. This rule mainly comes into play when extracting treasure from underground. In this case, it's fine to merge treasure into one slot of a particular value, such as noting "sack of six gems, value 4" on one slot.

Where possible, error towards giving items one slot each. This is a useful and necessary abstraction, partly justified by all the other gear characters are burdened with. Yes, of course, a deck of cards doesn't weigh the same as a shield, but slots are not just raw encumbrance, but also _personal value_ and importance for a character. If the things on a character sheet are lighter, it means that character is most likely carrying more of the other sorts of gear.

# Appraisal

The value of something may not always be known when it is found. To find the true value of such a thing, **research** must be conducted during [_downtime_](DOWNTIME.md). However, a character may be able to find a ballpark value in the moment if they have the correct sort of background. Use the following for guidance.

## Character Classes and Types for Valuables

* Strong: Weapons, armor, beasts.
* Wise: Scrolls, wands, plants, mysteries, maps.
* Deft: Jewelry, art, finery.

## Appraise

When something of unknown value is discovered in the dungeon or wilds, a character may test Wis to **appraise** the valuable if they have appropriate background knowledge.

* Critical: The perfect buyer is known.
* Strong: Exact value is known.
* Weak: Ballpark value is known.
* Miss: Value is unknown.
* Fumble: Character perceives item as worth much more than it is.

On a **critical**, the exact value is known and the character knows a character that specifically is looking for this thing. The character may be in a faction or may be someone interacted with during [_downtime_](DOWNTIME.md). If the valuable is given to this character, its value is **one more** than the actual value.

If the result is a **weak success**, only a ballpark value is known. The gamemaster secretly rolls a d6 and d4. If the d6 is odd, the d4 result is subtracted from the actual value and that number is told to the player. If the d6 is even, the d4 result is added to the actual value and that number is told to the player.

On a fumble, the value is not known. However, the character thinks the valuable is priceless, and must carry the item back to town, freeing up enough item slots to make room. In addition, the value is **one less** than actual, as the valuable is not at all what the character thought it was. Note this value on the character sheet. When arriving back in town, the item must be banked for this value.
