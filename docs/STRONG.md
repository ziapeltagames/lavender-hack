* Hit Die: d8

## Starting Features

**Dealer of Death**: After **regrouping** or a night's rest, gain a number of d6 dice equal to level. Those dice may be used during any successful **melee attack** to add additional damage. After the dice are rolled, they are used up until the character **regroups** or rests overnight.

**Mighty Thews**: Gain bonus encumbrance slots equal to Con modifier.

**Weapon and Armor Repair**: During **regrouping**, the Strong may **repair weapons or armor**. If the gear die type is higher than or equal to the current armor or weapon die type to be repaired, roll the gear die and increase the armor or weapon die one step, up to max effectiveness.

## Advanced Features

**Cleave**: When one of your **melee attacks** reduces an opponent to zero or negative hit points, you may immediately make another attack with that weapon on a nearby opponent.

**Combat Maneuver**: On a strong success from a **melee attack**, may disarm an opponent's weapon, push them back ten feet, or sunder their shield in addition to normal damage.

**Tank**: Anytime the armor die is rolled, roll with advantage.

**Power Attack**: May add a gear die roll to **melee damage**.

**Toughness**: This feature may be taken more than once. Each time it is taken, add Constitution modifier to new hit points rolled when leveling up.

**Stronger**: This feature may be taken more than once. Increase a Strength or Constitution by one. This is in addition to the normal increase when leveling up.
