# Dungeon Exploration

**Dungeon exploration** begins when the characters arrive in a dungeon they wish to explore that has a corresponding numbered **grid map** of rooms, passages, doorways, and important features. At least one **encounter** table is also necessary to determine what sorts of beasts and factions may be found in the dungeon.

## Turns and Rooms

During dungeon exploration, time is measured in **turns** of roughly ten minutes. Using a stack of six different colored poker chips is an effective way to track an hour of time (red, black, black, red, black, black). This is intentionally similar to the six watches a day for wilderness exploration, except the first and fourth turns track light instead of food.

Additionally, three poker chips are needed to track the passing of hours. Each time six turns pass, one hour goes by. Track this by placing one poker chip in the hours stack. After the fourth hour, reset the hour tracking and move time forward one watch. Dungeon exploration doesn't typically last much longer than a watch or two, since it tends to deplete resources much quicker than wilderness exploration.

Distance in the dungeon is tracked via **rooms of roughly 1,000 square feet**. This requires some hand waving to use effectively. A long hallway may need to be broken up into multiple rooms, while a set of very small rooms would be considered one room for purposes of exploration time. In most published adventures, any keyed area with a number or a name is probably one room. The important thing is to be aggressive with keeping time moving.

## Wonder

Dungeons have a **wonder rating from 1 to 8.** This reflects how obscure and potentially lucrative the knowledge and valuables located within the dungeon are. It frequently tracks closely with the amount of danger present. Different areas or sections of a larger dungeon may have different levels of wonder.

## Dungeon Exploration Procedure

1. At the start of a new hour, determine **dungeon events**.
2. Spotlight player chooses one of the following actions for the group.
    1. **Explore** a new room, **travel** through already explored rooms, or **search** the current room.
        1. Takes one or two turns, depending on encumbrance.
        2. On the first and fourth turns, **roll the light die**.
    2. **Craft torches** or **rebalance gear**.
        1. One turn.
        2. On the first and fourth turns, **roll the light die**.
    3. **Regroup**.
        1. Takes one watch.
        2. **Roll the light die.**
    4. **Camp**.
        1. Takes two watches.
        2. **Roll the light die.**
3. Track time for the chosen action.
    1. If six turns have passed, mark another hour of time and reset the turns.
    2. If four hours have passed, mark another watch of time and reset the hours.
    3. On every watch, **roll the fellowship die**.
    4. On the first and fourth watch, **roll the food die**.

# Dungeon Events

To determine **dungeon events**, the gamemaster makes a general test, and rolls on the subtable indicated, if necessary.

* Critical: Surprise!
* Strong: Close Encounter.
* Weak: Distant Encounter.
* Miss: None.
* Fumble: Discovery.

## Encounter

Most events in the dungeon are encounters. Each dungeon or section of dungeon will need an encounter table stocked with creatures and factions that may be in the area. Another fun addition to dungeon encounter tables are rival adventuring parties. **Roll a d6** to determine the turn when the encounter will occur.

For **distant** encounters, the characters have plenty of warning before the encounter occurs. The target of the encounter is a few rooms away, and the characters hear them approaching. This is the most common result on the table. It's a way to let the players choose how to handle a coming threat: run away, try to create a barrier, ambush them. It makes for difficult choices if the threat is coming from the direction the players were intending to go.

If there's a **close** encounter, there's no time to react. The creatures have stumbled into the room. The **encounter procedure** should be used to determine how to handle this. In the **surprise** encounter, the creatures or factions were lying in wait for the characters. It's time to fight on.

### Blather

At first blush, this is a fairly high encounter rate. It works better with dungeons that are not packed wall to wall with monsters in every room. The _Dwimmermount_ megadungeon is an excellent example of this philosophy. Having blank space lets the dungeon breathe more, allowing factions to patrol and move around. It also makes it less of a goal to go room by room, trying to clear every chamber of danger, because one of the higher sources for encounters are the random tables for the dungeon. This helps incentivize pushing deeper when the opportunity arises, because returning to the dungeon doesn't mean it's all that much easier to traverse.

## Holding Portals

There are occasions where characters may attempt to seal themselves off in a relatively "safe" portion of the dungeon. Dungeons being what they are, though, this is fraught with peril. If there is an encounter with curious creatures capable of opening or destroying such barriers, **roll the gear die**. If the gear die fails, the barrier does not hold, and the creatures make their way in.

## Discovery

If the party has a discovery, they will stumble upon a valuable. **Roll a d6** to determine the turn when the valuable is found. It should be fairly obvious, since they aren't searching for it. If it's an area of the dungeon already explored, perhaps it is being carried by an explorer who has met an unfortunate end.

The value is based on the wodner of the dungeon where the discovery is made. Make a general test, calculating the value as follows. 

* Critical: Wonder + 2
* Strong: Wonder + 1
* Weak: Wonder
* Miss: Wonder - 1

# Exploration and Travel

The movement in dungeons is similar to that of wilderness, just substituting rooms for hexes and ignoring scout tests. **Exploration** is moving to a new room the characters haven't been to before, which takes **one turn**. When characters **travel** through rooms they have already visited, they may move through **two rooms in one turn**.

## Encumbrance

If one or more characters in the party are encumbered, it takes **two turns to explore** and only **one room may be traveled** through each turn.

## Caution

The default movement rate assumes a fairly high level of caution. When players explore a new room, describe the area with a good amount of detail. This includes any sounds that may be coming from beyond doors or down halls. The standard level of caution assumes that characters are listening carefully, moving somewhat slowly, and generally trying to stay aware of their surroundings. However, they will not automatically find traps or hidden doors or treasures in the room they are in. For that, they must search.

## Running

There are times, particularly when chased by horrible things, that characters care far more about speed than caution. When running, characters move at **double rate**. For example, if they are unencumbered, they can **travel through four rooms** in a turn. Exploration is still slower than travel, even when running, due to dealing with unexpected terrain. Much better to run toward a known entrance than deeper into the dungeon! The rules for chasing are in the encounters section.

# Search

If there is something of interest in the room, it is found. This is commonly used to find secret doors, traps, and treasure. If there are multiple things of interest, only one is found for each turn spent searching. Remember again that room is a general term that includes corridors and hallways!

## Traps

Traps are a common feature of dungeons. If characters search a room for traps, they will find one, provided it is there. Otherwise, most traps allow some sort of success test to avoid them or take less damage. When running, these tests are made with disadvantage.

### Blather

I've never found rolling a die to find things all that interesting. If the players are searching for something, they find it. Time pressure makes constant searching costly.

# Regroup

Regrouping in the dungeon is more restrictive than it is in the wilds. To initiate regrouping, the spotlight player **rolls the light die and the fellowship die**. Regrouping takes an entire watch, but the light die is only rolled once, as staying in place helps to conserve resources. If this is the first or fourth watch of the day, the food die must be rolled as normal.

During regrouping, characters may either **heal** or **memorize a working**. If a player wishes to heal, they gain hit points equal to a roll of the character's hit die.

## Events

Resolve the event rolled at the beginning of the hour during the regroup action. Only one event occurs during regrouping, since there are fewer events when characters aren't moving.

# Camp

Camping is also more restrictive in the dungeon than it is in the wilds. To initiate camping, the spotlight player **rolls the light die once and the fellowship die twice**. Camping takes two watches, but the light die is only rolled once, as it is easier to conserve that resource while not moving. The food die is rolled as normal if either of the watches spent camping are the first or the fourth of the day.

During camping, each character gains hit points equal to a roll of the character's hit die. Additionally, all spellcasters may refresh their workings.

## Events

Resolve the event rolled at the beginning of the hour during the camp action. Additionally, one more event is rolled during camping. It is more dangerous to camp in dungeons!

# Crafting Torches and Rebalancing Gear

As an action that takes one turn, the spotlight player may **step down the gear die to set the light die at a d6**, or **step down the fellowship die to set the gear die at a d6**. This can be done for free while regrouping or camping.
