# Factions

Since trade is one of the most important parts of _Lavendar Hack_, it makes sense that there must be groups to trade _with_. That's where factions come in. Factions are the various groups large and small that characters might encounter while far away from home. The characters' home is special, and is covered under the rules for **downtime**.

Factions are not necessarily composed entirely of one culture. The diversity of a faction, along with various cultural norms and practices, is independent of the characteristics used to describe them. For each faction in the game, figure out their **disposition**, **approach**, **languages**, types of goods they **supply** and **demand**, and what the faction **wants**.

## Disposition

The most important characteristic of a faction is their disposition toward the characters, measured as a value from 0 (openly hostile) to 10 (very friendly). Disposition is on the same scale as value, as they are interrelated. Over the course of a campaign, disposition may raise or lower based on the activity of the characters and other forces.

A faction with a disposition of 0 has no interest in interacting the the characters at all, unless the intention is to imprison or injure them, while a faction with a disposition of 10 are certainly more welcoming of the characters than the people of their own home.

| Disposition | Attitude |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Hostile |
| 2-3 | Unfriendly |
| 4-5 | Uncertain |
| 6-7 | Indifferent |
| 8-9 | Friendly |
| 10 | Enthusiastic |

## Approach

Factions have different ways they prefer to interact with others. This is characterized with an approach, which is either **rapport**, **command**, **intimidation**, or **logic**. Each faction has one favored approach.

## Languages

Each faction also has one or more languages they are capable of conversing in. If characters don't know the language of the faction, that can make interactions with them much more difficult.

## Supply and Demand

Different cultures have very different ideas of value, whether driven by preference or scarcity. If a culture supplies a certain type of valuable (such as potions), its value is **one less** in all interactions with the faction. If a culture demands a certain type of valuable, its value is worth **one more** in interactions with the faction. Naturally, it's worth giving a culture what they demand and getting what a culture supplies! A faction may supply or demand any number of types of things, or none at all.

## Wants

Factions always have things they want. These might be tasks, such as opening a road, or stopping the attacks by the undead. They can also be valuables, such as a cockatrice feather or a bar made of platinum. The valuables wanted by a faction don't necessarily need to be worth a great amount, but they should be fairly hard to come by. Although it's _okay_ to have a faction want something like 10,000 copper pennies, that's a little boring. Helping the faction get what they want improves their disposition.

# Downtime

A faction that has a disposition of 8 or higher (friendly or better) may be used as a downtime location by characters.
