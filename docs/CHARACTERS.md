# Characters

_Lavender Hack_ uses four classes, each of which is a broad archetype: **Strong**, **Wise**, **Deft**, and **Weird**. With the exception of Weird, the classes map roughly to the B/X idea of warriors, spellcasters, and rogues.

### Blather

Those class names are from _Whitehack_. Still undecided on going that route rather than more standard class archetypes. Having broader classes can offer up more customization. But having a stronger archetype, like a paladin or a cleric, makes it easier for people familiar with D&D to engage quicker.

## Hit Dice

Classes have **hit dice**, which are rolled at character creation to determine starting **hit points**. Hit dice are rolled at other times as well. The higher the hit die type, the more hit points a character has, which reflects their endurance and toughness. Hit points are used heavily in combat. When a character drops down to zero hit points, they can become badly wounded.

## Primary Abilities

Classes have **primary abilities** which have a prominent role in tests for that class. The Strong use Strength and Constitution, the Wise use Intelligence and Wisdom, the Deft use Dexterity and Charisma, and the Weird do not have primary abilities.

## Class Level

Character classes have **levels** between 1 and 10. When making a new character, they start at level 1. As the character grows and explores and hopefully survives the trials of being an adventurer, they gain levels. With new levels comes more hit points and new and more interesting options to explore. The process of leveling up is described in [Downtime](DOWNTIME.md).

## Class Features

**Features** are special abilities that each class has available to them. They help the class fit into a niche within the game. Higher level characters have more and better class features available to them.

## Backgrounds and Advantage

Each character has a **background** which helps to define them. If the background is relevant to a test, the player may **gain advantage** on the test roll. However, utilizing a background potentially requires the right gear, so if the result is a **weak success**, the gear die must be rolled! The gear die is potentially rolled more than once if the weak success already requires a resource roll. 

Each character class has sample backgrounds that may be chosen from or rolled on during character creation.

### Blather

This is a substitute for a skill system. It's useful to create an evocative and interesting background that is useful in a few situations, which isn't an easy skill to develop. If a background is too broad it can feel watered down, but if it's hyper focused, it may never feel applicable.

It may be worth having more ways to gain advantage than a background. _Whitehack_ uses the concept of groups, which are tied to particular ability scores. These are a little like aspects from _Fate Core_, but they don't have an additional currency needed to invoke them. Still haven't decided if having something like that is worth the overhead. It can give characters more depth. I don't want any more currencies to track aspect invokes.

# Primary Abilities and the Gear Die

Classes may use the gear die for any test that uses their primary abilities. This may be done after the test roll results are known, as long as the test roll is not a fumble or a critical. Fumbles and criticals may never be modified! The gear die is rolled, and the result is added to the test. Handy! As usual, if the gear die is **used** (1-3 result), it is stepped down.

Since The Weird don't have primary abilities, they can't use the gear die for this.

# Character Creation

Use the following steps when creating a new character.

* Roll 3d6 in order for Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma
    * Record ability modifiers for each ability score
* Choose a class (Strong, Wise, Deft, Weird)
* Roll or choose from class background table
* Roll hit points using class hit die
    * Roll with advantage and add Con
* Roll on class starting gear tables
    * Add Str+5 for starting encumbrance slots (2-8 starting slots)
* Record starting class features
