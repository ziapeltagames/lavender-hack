# Characters

_Lavender Hack_ uses four classes, each of which is a broad archetype: **Strong**, **Wise**, **Deft**, and **Weird**. The classes map roughly to the B/X idea of warriors, spellcasters, and rogues. The Weird don't map to those very well. The classes also have primary abilities: Strong use Strength and Constitution, Wise use Intelligence and Wisdom, Deft use Dexterity and Charisma, and Weird do not have primary abilities.

### Blather

Those class names are from _Whitehack_. Still undecided on going that route rather than the more standard class names.

## Backgrounds

Each character has a background which helps to define them. If the background is relevant to a test, the player may gain advantage on the test roll. However, utilizing a background potentially requires the right gear, so if the result is a weak success, the resource die must be rolled (again if the weak success already requires a resource roll).

To-do: Create some tables for each class with suitable background ideas.

### Blather

This is a substitute for a skill system. It's useful to create a focused and interesting background, which isn't an easy skill to develop. If a background is too broad it can feel watered down, but if it's hyper focused, it may never feel applicable.

## Character Creation

* Roll 3d6 in order for Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma
    * Record ability modifiers
* Roll or create a background
* Choose a class (Strong, Wise, Deft, Weird)
* Roll hit points using class hit die
    * Roll with advantage and add Con
* Roll d6 for starting gear
    * Starting slots are 5+Str
* Record starting class abilities

## Primary Abilities and the Gear Die

Classes may roll the gear die for any test that uses their primary abilities. This may be done after the test roll, as long as the test roll is not a fumble or a critical. Those results can't be modified. As usual, if the gear die roll is a 1-3, it is stepped down.
