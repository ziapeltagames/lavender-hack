# The Weird

The weird is an experimental class still in progress. It does not have much content yet. It may eventually be ported to a specific setting that's in the works, rather than a generally available class.

* Hit Die: d6
* Primary Abilities: None
* Armor: None
* Weapons: Any

## Features

**Weirdness**: The Weird, naturally, have weirdness. Choose two first level weirdness during character creation. At each new level, gain one weirdness equal to level attained.

* Level 1) Nibbler, 2) Swap
* Level 2) Beastfriend, 2) Weight

**Fatigue**: The Weird use a fatigue usage die. It is rolled each time weirdness is used. Frequently weirdness uses the result of the fatigue die. When it is gone, no more weirdness may be used. After a **full rest**, it is reset to a d8.

## Gear Die

The Weird can't use the gear die.
