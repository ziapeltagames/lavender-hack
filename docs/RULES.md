# Core Rules

Because one of the goals of _Lavender Hack_ is to work with B/X content, much of this will look familiar to anyone who has played that style of game. There are ability scores, twenty sided dice, classes, hit points, gear, combat, and exploration. There are some different bits as well, which will become apparent shortly.

# Ability Scores

Ability scores are a very core part of the game, and the first thing you calculate when making a character. There are six, and they should come as no surprise: **Strength (Str)**, **Dexterity (Dex)**, **Wisdom (Wis)**, **Intelligence (Int)**, **Constitution (Con)**, and **Charisma (Cha)**. Since you've already played this sort of game, I'm not going to spend words explaining how to interpret them.

These ability scores start on the 3-18 scale, but it is possible for them to be raised higher than that later on. Along with the value of the ability score, there is also a modifier, which can range from -3 to +3. The modifiers are calculated as follows.

## Ability Score Modifiers

* 18: +3
* 16-17: +2
* 13-15: +1
* 9-12: +0
* 6-8: -1
* 4-5: -2
* 3: -3

Ability score modifiers are far more important to the game than the actual score. If the game text says something like **add Con** or **+ Str**, that means adding the ability score modifier, never the original ability score. The modifier added may be negative, thus lowering the result! The ability scores can change over the course of the game (particularly as your character grows in power), which may also change the associated modifier.

# Tests

The game relies on an ongoing dialog between a gamemaster and the players. The gamemaster gets the ball rolling by setting scenes and situations that the players find themselves in. At certain points, a player will want to accomplish something which is both **uncertain** and **interesting**. The players may decide a die roll is called for to figure out what happens. How _difficult_ a thing is to do is less important than whether both success and failure are _interesting_.

The player gives a vague outline of what their character is intending to do. It is important not to fill in too many details, because the die roll will determine what happens! The players then determine which ability score is most applicable to this action. After that a d20 (twenty sided die) is rolled and the related ability score modifier is added to the result.

If the final tally (d20 roll plus attribute modifier) is an **8 or higher**, the test **succeeds**. If it's below that number, the action **fails** and there is some sort of consequence. Frequently, finer granularity is needed beyond just determining whether an action succeeds or fails. In that case, the following degrees of success and failure are used.

* Natural 20: **Critical** Success
* 18+: **Strong** Success
* 8+: **Weak** Success
* 7-: **Miss**
* Natural 1: **Fumble**

The **natural** above refers to a d20 test roll that shows the number in question, regardless of modifiers. For example, if you're making a Strength test with a +2 modifier to the roll, and the roll shows an 18, that is **not** a critical even though the total is a 20. A weak success may incur some sort of cost as part of success, or is perhaps a lesser degree of success.

### Blather

I really wanted to keep the widely known d20 interpretations of 1 as a fumble or massive failure and 20 as a critical success. The roll under ability score OSR variants like _Black Hack_ or _Whitehack_ are cleanly designed, but there's a ton of cultural inertia around what rolling a 20 means. The other issue with roll under is that it requires changes to the generation of ability scores. I really like the historical precedent of rolling 3d6 straight down. Using roll under with that approach to character creation makes for potentially wildly ineffective or overpowered characters.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Some situations can result in a test roll having **advantage** or **disadvantage**. If a player has advantage on a test, they roll two dice and take the result they wish. If they have disadvantage, they roll two dice and the GM takes the result they wish. This frequently applies to tests (d20 rolls), but could apply to any other dice rolls (of any dice type) as specified. If a player has both advantage and disadvantage on a roll, they cancel each other out.

## Keep Criticals and Fumbles

Other situations may allow a player to modify the result in various ways, or re-roll the result. This may allow them to change a miss into a weak success or a weak success into a strong success. However, **fumbles and criticals can't be altered after the roll**. That's the result.

## General Tests

Sometimes a test is called for that does not use any ability score modifier. This is referred to as a **general test**. Frequently this is done by the gamemaster, with the results being interpreted based on the degree of success or failure for the roll. Events in the dungeon and wilderness are an example of this sort of test.

## Saves

**Saves** are tests which are reactive. They work the same way as other tests, but they tend to be driven be the gamemaster or as a consequence of some action taken by the player. For instance, if a poisonous beast bites a character, they may have to make a save using their Constitution. As usual, an 8+ is successful. Degrees of success and failure may be used to further distinguish results as normal for tests.

# Moves

Some tests have specific fictional situations and results under which they can occur. These sorts of tests are called **moves**. If there is an applicable move, use that instead of the general test framework. For example, the following move is used when a character is fighting with a hand weapon in combat. Don't worry about what the results in this example mean for now.

The important thing to understand is that moves typically have choices or results for each degree of success and failure. Sometimes these are further choices for a player to make. Move also describe when they should be used and what ability score to use as well. This is described in the text using phrase like **test Str** or **make a Cha test**.

## Example Melee Attack Move

_When you're nearby an enemy in combat with a melee weapon in hand, test Str to make a **melee attack**._

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Strong: Roll damamge and bypass armor
* Weak: Roll damage and choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Exertion (lower armor die value, to a minimum of one)
   * Exposed position (next defense roll is at disadvantage)
* Miss: Miss the target
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

As you can see, a weak success entails further choices on the part of a character. There are also some fictional conditions necessary to make this move: a character must be nearby an enemy.

## Moves Without Tests

Moves don't necessarily need to involve tests. They could be a list of choices or some bookkeeping sort of activity to undertake during a particular fictional situation.

# Procedures

**Procedures** are sequences of steps used to handle situations that occur in the game, such as exploration or combat. Procedures tend to be tactical and turn based in nature. There are usually various choices players may make at each step of the procedure, and procedures frequently use moves to resolve what happens.

Essentially, procedures tie together sequences of tests and moves, typically in a turn based format, and make it part of a mini-game. Such as using a **melee attack** in combat. Procedures additionally have other sorts of choices and steps to figure out what happens. The most important procedures in _Lavender Hack_ are **exploration**, **court**, **combat**, and **downtime**.

### Blather

The concept of moves come from [_Apocalypse World_](http://apocalypse-world.com/).  _Apocalypse World_ burst forth on the RPG scene in 2010 and had a major impact on game design. There are quite a few PbtA (Powered by the Apocalypse) games which leverage, to varying degrees of success, the tech from _Apocalypse World_. However, moves are not usually grounded in larger procedures, but rather are free floating things that trigger when the fictional situation they refer to occurs. This is the idea that RPGs are a conversation and moves trigger as part of that.

For myself, I like the idea of more free flowing mechanical widgets which can be triggered to push the fiction in all sorts of interesting directions. However, I really like structured mini-games as well, such as Duel of Wits in [_Burning Wheel_](https://www.burningwheel.com/) or combat in [_The One Ring_](http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/the-one-ring/). Turns have an advantage over moves in that the spotlight tends to get deliberately shared more, and mini-games add tactical diversity and strategy to the system.

_Lavender Hack_ mixes move sorts of structures along with tactical procedures and mini-games. _Apocalypse World_ purists might blanch at this approach, but I see no incompatibility from switching between the freeform "talk in the funny voices" parts of rpgs and the "win at a game" parts of rpgs. It's usually easy enough to tell which is which.

# Spotlight Player

_Lavender Hack_ occasionally has choices and die rolls that aren't directly related to any particular character. A **spotlight player** makes these choices and die rolls. The spotlight player should be chosen at the beginning of the session. Rotate the spotlight around, so that players alternate the responsibility. Occasionally the spotlight player endures further complications or hardships for their character! The spotlight isn't always positive.

# Usage Dice

**Usage dice** are a general purpose tracking mechanism heavily used (ahem) in _Lavender Hack_. Usage dice change die type based on situations in the game. This forms a ladder of sorts, going from d12 at the highest to a d2 at the lowest: **d12 <--> d10 <--> d8 <--> d6 <--> d4 <--> d2(0)**. A d20 is used for the lowest step. A usage die can never be above a d12 or below a d20.

When usage dice reflect an amount of something, the d12 represents having a lot of it and the d20 represents just scraping by. For example, a d12 food die means the characters have plenty of food of all different kinds, and a d20 means they have a few very questionable berries found while foraging. If used for quality, a d12 represents something of the highest quality, while a d20 represents something makeshift. For example, if used for light, a d12 is a number of lanterns with plenty of oil, while a d2 is a makeshift candle using a torn bit of clothing.

If the rules instruct you to **step up** a usage die, you increase the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped out with a d10. If the rules instruct you to **step down** a usage die, you lower the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped with a d6. There are a variety of ways and reasons usage dice are stepped up and down. A d12 can't be stepped up and a d20 can't be stepped down. A d20 usage die is referred to as **broken**.

## Usage Test

Usage dice might be rolled for a variety of reasons. If the result of rolling a usage die is a **1-3**, the die is **stepped down** in addition to any other potential effects. The more usage dice are used, the more they're used up! A 1, 2, or 3 result means the thing was **used**, and can occasionally trigger an additional effect besides stepping the die type down.

This process of rolling a usage die, checking the result, and then determining if it should be stepped down is called a **usage test**. Sometimes the only thing that matters is if the die is stepped down or not.

## Usage Save

If players are forced to roll a d20 usage die, the result is almost never good! Each type of usage die has a set of general test results that is used for this purpose. Rolling a d20 usage die is referred to as **making a usage save**. The spotlight player rolls the usage die and looks up the related save results to determine the value and what happens!

### Blather

Usage dice come from the game [_Black Hack_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition), although they are also used very effectively and extensively in [_Macchiato Monsters_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264169/Macchiato-Monsters). In _Black Hack_ they lower on a 1-2. I used the _MM_ version, which is where the 1-3 comes from. Stepping down on a 1-3 ensures a little more movement, even for larger die types.

I love the concept of usage dice, although getting them to function well as an economy is one of the most active parts of development. Who knows, maybe they won't be as good of a fit as simple counters. In order for them to be viable, they need to be rolled fairly frequently!

# Resources

There are four important party level **resources**, each tracked with a usage die. They are **food**, **fellowship**, **gear**, and **light**. Resources are detailed in the [Resources](RESOURCES.md) section of the [Valuables](VALUABLES.md) chapter.

## Gear

The gear usage die tracks just that, adventuring gear the party has available. These are things like blankets, backpacks, oil flasks, lockpicks, writing ink, spellbooks, and large burlap sacks. In short, most everything the well equipped adventurer needs! The higher the die type, the better the quality and quantity of gear. Different character class abilities can use the gear die to varying effect.

One common way to use the gear die is to help with a test. Each class may **add a gear die roll** to tests that use the **primary ability scores** of that class. See the [Character](CHARACTERS.md) chapter for more details.

### Blather

There tends to be lots of assorted gear that players track on their character sheets. Most of it is very similar and creates overhead without much interesting choice. The gear die abstracts all of that out. In essence, the only items tracked by players will be iconic weapons, armor, treasure, and very unique items. This fits in well with the abstract slots based weight system that _Lavender Hack_ uses, since there aren't many slots available, the assumption being you're already weighed down by stuff not on your character sheet.

The gear die also provides an interesting mechanism for different classes to exploit narratively. For example, thieves might be able to use it to make a trap, warriors can use it to fix broken armor, and spellcasters can use it for better spell components.

## Food and Light

Food and light are tracked indepently from other gear, as they have a more important role during wilderness and dungeron exploration. See the [Exploration](EXPLORATION.md) chapter for more details.

## Fellowship

Fellowship represents party cohesion. If the group is happy, well rested, and ready to go, fellowship will be high. It is stepped down during stressful situations such as dungeon exploration. Fellowship is particularly important during trading and interactions with factions. See the [Court](COURT.md) section for more details.# Characters

_Lavender Hack_ uses four classes, each of which is a broad archetype: **Strong**, **Wise**, **Deft**, and **Weird**. With the exception of Weird, the classes map roughly to the B/X idea of warriors, spellcasters, and rogues.

### Blather

Those class names are from _Whitehack_. Still undecided on going that route rather than more standard class archetypes. Having broader classes can offer up more customization. But having a stronger archetype, like a paladin or a cleric, makes it easier for people familiar with D&D to engage quicker.

## Hit Dice

Classes have **hit dice**, which are rolled at character creation to determine starting **hit points**. Hit dice are rolled at other times as well. The higher the hit die type, the more hit points a character has, which reflects their endurance and toughness. Hit points are used heavily in combat. When a character drops down to zero hit points, they can become badly wounded.

## Primary Abilities

Classes have **primary abilities** which have a prominent role in tests for that class. The Strong use Strength and Constitution, the Wise use Intelligence and Wisdom, the Deft use Dexterity and Charisma, and the Weird do not have primary abilities.

## Class Level

Character classes have **levels** between 1 and 10. When making a new character, they start at level 1. As the character grows and explores and hopefully survives the trials of being an adventurer, they gain levels. With new levels come more hit points and new and more interesting options to explore. The process of leveling up is described in [Downtime](DOWNTIME.md).

## Class Features

**Features** are special abilities that each class has available to them. They help the class fit into a niche within the game. Higher level characters have more and better class features available to them.

In the class descriptions, **starting features** are available immediately. One **advanced feature** may be chosen each time the class gains a level. Many of the class features are used in procedures that are fleshed out later in the book.

## Backgrounds and Advantage

Each character has a **background** which helps to define them. If the background is relevant to a test, the player may **gain advantage** on the test roll. However, utilizing a background potentially requires the right gear, so if the result is a **weak success**, the gear die must be rolled! The gear die is potentially rolled more than once if the weak success already requires a resource roll. 

Each character class has sample backgrounds that may be chosen from or rolled on during character creation.

### Blather

Backgrounds are a substitute for a skill system. It's useful to create an evocative and interesting background that is useful in a few situations, which isn't an easy skill to develop. If a background is too broad it can feel watered down, but if it's hyper focused, it may never feel applicable.

It may be worth having more ways to gain advantage than a background. _Whitehack_ uses the concept of groups, which are tied to particular ability scores. These are a little like aspects from _Fate Core_, but they don't have an additional currency needed to invoke them. Still haven't decided if having something like that is worth the overhead. It can give characters more depth. I don't want any more currencies to track aspect invokes.

# Primary Abilities and the Gear Die

Classes may use the gear die for any test that uses their primary abilities. This may be done after the test roll results are known, as long as the test roll is not a fumble or a critical. Fumbles and criticals may never be modified! The gear die is rolled, and the result is added to the test. Handy! As usual, if the gear die is **used** (1-3 result), it is stepped down.

Since The Weird don't have primary abilities, they can't use the gear die for this.

# Character Creation

Use the following steps when creating a new character.

* Roll 3d6 in order for Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma
    * Record ability modifiers for each ability score
* Choose a class (Strong, Wise, Deft, Weird)
* Roll or choose from class background table

## Starting Features

**Dealer of Death**: After **regrouping** or a night's rest, gain a number of d6 dice equal to level. Those dice may be used during any successful **melee attack** to add additional damage. After the dice are rolled, they are used up until the character **regroups** or rests overnight.

**Mighty Thews**: Gain bonus encumbrance slots equal to Con modifier.

**Weapon and Armor Repair**: During **regrouping**, the Strong may **repair weapons or armor**. If the gear die type is higher than or equal to the current armor or weapon die type to be repaired, roll the gear die and increase the armor or weapon die one step, up to max effectiveness.

## Advanced Features

**Cleave**: When one of your **melee attacks** reduces an opponent to zero or negative hit points, you may immediately make another attack with that weapon on a nearby opponent.

**Combat Maneuver**: On a strong success from a **melee attack**, may disarm an opponent's weapon, push them back ten feet, or sunder their shield in addition to normal damage.

**Tank**: Anytime the armor die is rolled, roll with advantage.

## Advanced Features

TBD

## Starting Equipment

1. Willow Wand
2. Robe of Shimmer
3. Deathcat# Valuables

_Lavender Hack_ uses an abstract concept of **value**. Valuables are sorted into ten broad value categories, each of exponential worth. _LHC_ uses a copper penny standard for currency, when there is currency, which isn't often. Instead, value tends to be very relative to different cultures the players encounter. A big part of _LHC_ is discovering and trading with different groups. The value in terms of copper pennies is only provided as a rough guideline. Occasionally it is necessary to compare a usage die to this scale, which is also given in the table below.

| Value | Usage Die | Copper Pennies | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | d20 | 1 | Moldy Potato |
| 2 | d4 | 5 | Bushel of Grain |
| 3 | d6 | 25 | Small Bell |
| 4 | d8 | 125 | Shield |
| 5 | d10 | 625 | Longsword |
| 6 | d12 | 3,000 | Half Plate |
| 7 | - | 15,000 | Full Plate |
| 8 | - | 80,000 | Stone Tower |
| 9 | - | 400,000 | Warship |
| 10 | - | 2,000,000 | Stronghold |

Valuables are described by a **type**, a **value**, and the number of **slots** required to carry it. Valuables are things like treasure, jewels, maps, scrolls, and clothing. But also unique types of equipment like weapons or armor which aren't covered by the gear die. Weapons and armor are further described by how much damage they do or how much protection they afford.

The type of a valuable is a general class, such as clothing, art, armor, jewelry, potion, animal, or plant. It is used when trading with factions, as they may favor certain types of valuables over others.

### Blather

The general exchange rate is 5:1 across each row of the value table. This mainly comes into play during [_Downtime_](DOWNTIME.md). It typically takes five things of one value to make something of the next higher value. Making change is less efficient, at 1:4. _Lavender Hack_ reflects a world where currency exchange is a questionable proposition at best.

## Slots

Characters start the game with a number of slots equal to 5 + Str modifier. Most all items take one slot each. This isn't many slots, but it's assumed the character is carrying lots of other things not on their character sheet. Those things are represented by the gear, food, and light usage dice.

## Coins, Weight, and Slots

It takes roughly 100 coins or 10 pounds to occupy one slot. This also holds true for other lighter things like a piece of paper. This rule mainly comes into play when extracting treasure from underground. In this case, it's fine to merge treasure into one slot of a particular value, such as noting "sack of six gems, value 4" on one slot.

Where possible, error towards giving items one slot each. This is a useful and necessary abstraction, partly justified by all the other gear characters are burdened with. Yes, of course, a deck of cards doesn't weigh the same as a shield, but slots are not just raw encumbrance, but also _personal value_ and importance for a character. If the things on a character sheet are lighter, it means that character is most likely carrying more of the other sorts of gear.

# Appraisal

The value of something may not always be known when it is found. To find the true value of such a thing, **research** must be conducted during [_downtime_](DOWNTIME.md). However, a character may be able to find a ballpark value in the moment if they have the correct sort of background. Use the following for guidance.

## Character Classes and Types for Valuables

* Strong: Weapons, armor, beasts.
* Wise: Scrolls, wands, plants, mysteries, maps.
* Deft: Jewelry, art, finery.

## Appraise

When something of unknown value is discovered in the dungeon or wilds, a character may test Wis to **appraise** the valuable if they have appropriate background knowledge.

* Critical: The perfect buyer is known.
* Strong: Exact value is known.
* Weak: Ballpark value is known.
* Miss: Value is unknown.
* Fumble: Character perceives item as worth much more than it is.

On a **critical**, the exact value is known and the character knows a character that specifically is looking for this thing. The character may be in a faction or may be someone interacted with during [_downtime_](DOWNTIME.md). If the valuable is given to this character, its value is **one more** than the actual value.

If the result is a **weak success**, only a ballpark value is known. The gamemaster secretly rolls a d6 and d4. If the d6 is odd, the d4 result is subtracted from the actual value and that number is told to the player. If the d6 is even, the d4 result is added to the actual value and that number is told to the player.

On a fumble, the value is not known. However, the character thinks the valuable is priceless, and must carry the item back to town, freeing up enough item slots to make room. In addition, the value is **one less** than actual, as the valuable is not at all what the character thought it was. Note this value on the character sheet. When arriving back in town, the item must be banked for this value.# Resources

An important part _Lavender Hack_ is managing the four core resources represented by usage dice: food, fellowship, gear, and light. These dice step up and down based on the activities of players.

# Gear

As mentioned earlier, most common adventuring gear is abstracted out into the gear die. It is assumed characters have standard sorts of gear, such as appropriate clothing, tents, bedrolls, flint and steel, sacks, backpacks, rope, parchment, iron spikes, and class related items like repair kits, lockpicks, spellbooks, and spell reagents.

If the players want gear that is more odd, like a shrimp net or an hourglass, they may produce it, but must roll the gear die. Very specific things which may pertain to mission goals, like a unicorn horn, or magic items, like a balm of healing, can't be produced with the gear die. Also, gear produced this way can't be transferred to a character sheet. You can't use the gear die as an item generator for trade!

## Gear Save

The spotlight player makes a **gear save** when a d20 gear die is rolled.

* Critical: Improvised gear. Value is 4 and step up the gear die to a d4.
* Strong: Value is 4.
* Weak: Value is 3.
* Miss: Failed! Value is 0 and roll fellowship.
* Fumble: Catastrophe! Value is 0 and character in party using gear takes their hit die in damage.

# Food and Light

Food and light are tracked separately from other adventuring gear. They are heavily used in the [Exploration](EXPLORATION.md) section.

## Food Save

The spotlight player makes a **food save** when a d20 food die is rolled.

* Critical: Crafty foraging. Value is 4 and step up the food die to a d4.
* Strong: Value is 4.
* Weak: Value is 3.
* Miss: Going hungry. Value is 0 and roll fellowship.
* Fumble: Starving. Value is 0, roll fellowship, and any tests involving Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution are rolled with disadvantage until the food die is stepped up.

## Light Save

The spotlight player makes a **light save** when a d20 light die is rolled.

* Critical: Improvised torches. Value is 4 and step up the light die to a d4.
* Strong: Value is 4.
* Weak: Value is 3.
* Miss: Darkness. Value is 0 and roll fellowship. Any tests needing light are rolled with disadvantage.
* Fumble: Grue fodder. Value is 0, roll fellowship, and roll an encounter. The characters are in darkness. Any tests needing light are rolled with disadvantage. Furthermore, a random encounter occurs at this inopportune time. Hopefully the encountered group uses light sources!

# Fellowship

Fellowship is considered a resource, although it is a very different sort of resource than gear, food, and water. Fellowship represents how well the group is getting along together. As hardships increase, fellowship tends to step down. It is very important during [Court](COURT.md).

## Fellowship Save

The spotlight player makes a **fellowship save** when a d20 fellowship die is rolled.

* Critical: Growing through adversity. Value is 4 and step up the fellowship die to a d4.
* Strong: Value is 4.
* Weak: Value is 3.
* Miss: Simmering hatred. Value is 0 and one character leaves the party for d20 weeks. Roll up a new one to take their place. As usual, the spotlight player decides in the case of a disagreement.
* Fumble: 0. Death and Mayhem! Value is 0 and one character is murdered in their sleep. If the players can't decide who is the murderer and who is the murdered, the spotlight player decides.# Equipment

The only things written into slots on character sheets are valuables. Valuables which have some use other than just for value are referred to as equipment. These are things like weapons, armor, useful plants, parts of beasts, and magic items. General sorts of equipment, like tents and sleeping bags, are covered by the gear die.

# Weapons

Weapons additionally have a damage die, which is used during combat.

| Name | Damage | Value | Slots | Effects | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dagger | d4 | 3 | 1  |
| Shortsword | d6 | 3 | 1  |
| Longsword | d8 | 4 |  2 |
| Mace | d8 | 3 |  1 |
| Greatsword | d10 | 5 | 2 | Two Handed, Slow |  |
| Shortbow | d6 | 3 | 1 | Two Handed | Short |
| Longbow | d8 | 4 | 2 | Two Handed | Long |
| Crossbow | d10 | 4 | 2 | Two Handed, Slow | Long |
| Pistol | d10 | 6 | 1 | Gunpowder | Short |

Characters using slow weapons will always take slow actions during the combat procedure (don't roll initiative).

For various reasons, weapons can become less effective. If this happens, lower the damage die as if it was a usage die (d8 to d6, d6 to d4, etc). Record the new damage dice amount on the character sheet next to the original damage.

# Armor

Armor dice are used during combat, informing the players of how effective their armor is.

| Name | Protection | Value | Slots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Leather | d4 | 4 | 1 |
| Chain | d6 | 5 | 2 |
| Half Plate | d8 | 6 | 3 |
| Full Plate | d10 | 7 | 3 |
| Shield | +1 Step | 4 | 1 |

Note: A shield steps up the armor die once, in a similar fashion to a usage die. For example, leather and a shield is a d6 armor die. Armor, like weapons, can also become damaged.# Exploration

Exploration is the first of four pillars that support _Lavendar Hack_, the others being encounters, factions, and downtime. One of the goals of _Lavender Hack_ is to work well for wilderness **hexcrawls**, the sorts of adventures where characters go out into the hinterlands and figure out what's where and who's what. The term hexcrawl comes from the wealth of _B/X_ content which feature maps with hexes of varying scales, wherein each hex indicates terrain of a particular type.

The goal of the exploration system is to make distances feel distant, such that resources like food are a concern, and the chance for surprise encounters with beasts and factions is always a possibility. Ocean exploration is very similar to wilderness exploration, the principal difference being a faster movement rate, very different sorts of events, and a reliance on wind speeds and direction.

Of course, dungeons and dungeon exploration are the bread and butter of _B/X_ play. Unfortunately, dungeon maps, typically rendered on grids, do not provide as clean a unit of abstraction as hexes. This creates more difficulty when trying to come up with usable measures for time and distance. It also makes for more challenges when players try to make sense of where they are.

### Blather

I tried to make the procedures for each type of exploration (wilderness, dungeon, ocean) mirror each other somewhat closely. Exploration is built around the options of **exploring** a new place, **travelling** through somewhere you've been, **searching** where you are, and **resting**. In terms of time and distance, dungeon exploration is the most zoomed in, while ocean exploration is the most zoomed out. Dungeon exploration relies mostly on light, wilderness exploration mostly on food, and ocean exploration mostly on wind.

# Time and Distance

New units of time and distance are needed to handle exploration at the right level of abstraction. The new units of time are **watches** of roughly four hours and **turns** of roughly ten minutes. The new units of distance are **hexes** of roughly three miles across and **rooms** of roughly 1,000 square feet. Watches and hexes are used primarily for wilderness exploration, while turns and rooms are used for dungeon exploration.

### Blather

The term watch comes from _Hot Springs Island_ (not sure if it came from somewhere else first), and I really like that level of abstraction for wilderness exploration. It keeps the pace moving, which is important for a game featuring resource management. The AD&D 1E encounter system was broken up into six different time periods, although that was only for encounter checks, not as a unifying way to track time.

Turns are a B/X legacy term, going all the way back to the wargaming roots of D&D. I'm not fond of the word turn to describe ten minutes, but it has lots of cultural inertia behind it. _Black Hack_ uses hours, minutes, and seconds to describe these zoomed in time structures, which is consistent and matches casual language. However, the fact that the terms are plural can make speech a little clunky in a more procedural game like _Lavender Hack_, as in "what are you doing for these minutes".# Wilderness Exploration

**Wilderness exploration** begins when the characters arrive at a remote area they wish to explore that has a corresponding **hex map** of terrain and important sites. At least one **encounter** table is also necessary to determine what beasts and factions may be found in each sort of terrain.

The gamemaster determines where the players are located on the hex map. If this is after **downtime**, reset all resources to d8.

## Watches and Hexes

Time during wilderness exploration is divided into **four hour watches**, for a total of six watches each day (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night). Using a stack of different colored poker chips is an effective way to track this (red, yellow, yellow, red, black, black). Watches are tracked during wilderness exploration and dungeon exploration.

The standard hex is assumed to be three miles across and populated with terrain that is difficult to negotiate (mountains, jungle, woods). Hexes of different sizes will require slight modifications to this procedure.

## Wilderness Exploration Procedure

1. At the start of a new day, determine **wilderness events**.
2. Spotlight player chooses one of the following actions for the group.
    1. **Explore** a new hex, **travel** through an already explored hex, or **search** the current hex.
        1. Takes one or two watches, depending on encumbrance.
    4. **Regroup** and **rebalance gear**.
        1. One watch.
    5. **Camp**.
        1. Two watches.
4. One watch passes.
    1. If six watches have passed, mark another day of time and reset the watches.
    2. On the first (dawn) and fourth (dusk) watch, **roll the food die**.

# Wilderness Events

To determine **wilderness events**, the gamemaster makes a general test, and rolls on the subtable indicated, if necessary.

* Critical: Lair.
* Strong: Bad Weather.
* Weak: Encounter.
* Miss: None.
* Fumble: Discovery.

## Bad Weather

The bad weather result indicates bad weather appropriate for the type of terrain and season, such as a torrential downpour, a blizzard, or a dust storm. Bad weather lasts the entire day and makes outdoor activities much more difficult. Any rolls related to scouting, hunting, camping, and foraging are **made with disadvantage on a day with bad weather**.

## Encounter

The encounter result indicates an encounter with creatures or factions native to the area. **Roll a d6** to determine the watch when the encounter will occur (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night).

Most published products have encounter tables for each region the players may find themselves in. If they don't, it will be necessary to create one. It's useful if encounter tables aren't just a list of vicious monsters, but rather should include factions as well as less dangerous fauna that may be hunted or tracked.

Interactions with factions provide opportunities for trade and role-playing. If an encounter is indicated, use the **encounter procedure** to determine how the beasts or factions react to the characters. Every encounter shouldn't default to combat.

## Lair

In the case of a lair result, use the standard encounter tables, but instead of a roaming group, the beasts or faction are encountered in their lair. There are typically many more creatures in their lair then are found roaming. There also may be an opportunity for more treasure. If a hex already has a lair indicated, use that rather than creating a new one. The lair will be found in the next hex the party enters.

## Discovery

If the party has a discovery, they have found a resource they can use in the hex. Make a general test, consulting the table below. The discovery will be found in the next hex the party enters. Alternatively, if the hex already has something of value that could be discovered, that is now found, without needing to search for it.

* Critical: Fellowship.
    * An area of extreme beauty, rare spices, pipe weed.
* Strong: Light.
    * Discarded lantern oil, plants useful for making torches.
* Weak: Gear.
    * A cache of equipment, medicinal plants.
* Miss: Food.
    * Berries, squash, an abundance of fish.

Step up the indicated resource die (as usual, can never be higher than a d12). The nature of what is found should be appropriate to the type of die.

### Blather

The standard OSR way to handle encounters is to roll a die once for every unit of time (such as every watch), with the odds based on the sort of terrain the characters find themselves in. I prefer rolling less frequently, but having the odds for something happening be higher. That prevents the chance for a series of encounters back to back to back, which can start to feel a little tedious. Particularly if it's always monsters. However, it increases the chance that something is happening each day, which can make the world feel alive. I also like trying to include elements like weather and discoveries into the roll, hence using the word events rather than encounters.

I'm debating adding something like a spotlight system on a miss result. The spotlight would be a reminder to ask a player questions about their character, and make sure that more quiet players have the spotlight (if they want it). There may also be a mechanical benefit to being in the spotlight, such as gaining advantage on certain rolls. I like the idea of having something like that included in events.

# Exploration and Travel

**Exploration** is moving to a new hex the characters haven't been to before. Since it is a new hex, there is a chance the characters get lost. One character is nominated as a **scout**. The player of the scouting character makes a **Wis test**. On a success, the characters arrive at the desired hex, as normal. Remember that bad weather requires this roll be made with disadvantage!

On a failure, they have temporarily become lost, and end up in a random hex. The scout player should roll a d6. On a 1-4, the characters end up back where they started. On a 5, they veer left, ending up in the hex left of where they desired. On a 6, they veer right, ending up in the hex to the right of where they desired. In each case, the target hex remains unexplored, but the characters know where they are after the watch.

When characters **travel** through hexes they have already visited, they may move through two hexes in one watch. Scout checks are not needed.

## Blather

In the old AD&D 1E game, there was an involved procedure for becoming lost, whereby the GM secretly tracked where characters were, and players kind of fumbled about in the dark. I found it more fun in principal than in practice. Here, becoming lost primarily sacrifices time.

## Encumbrance

If one or more characters in the party are encumbered, it takes **two watches to explore** and only **one hex may be traveled** through each turn.

# Search

If there is something of interest in the hex, it is found. This is commonly used to find lairs or entrances to dungeons. If there are multiple things of interest, only one is found for each watch spent searching.

## Blather

I really like the _Hot Springs Island_ approach, where each hex has three things of interest that may be searched for. Giving players some knowledge of where and when to search makes it a more useful action to take.

# Regroup

Regrouping allows characters to individually choose from a variety of actions during the watch. Each player may choose a different action from the following list.

* Heal.
* Repair.
* Memorize.
* Forage.

Additionally, as part of regrouping, players may **rebalance gear**. This is down by stepping down the fellowship die, and setting the gear die to a d6.

## Heal

In a long rest, a player may roll their hit die and recover that many hit points.

## Repair

A character may repair a damaged weapon or armor. If the gear die is of a higher type than the damaged weapon or armor die, the player rolls the gear die and steps up a damaged weapon or armor die one step.

## Memorize Working

A player may memorize one working for their character if they have slots available.

## Forage

The player makes a **Wis test** and applies the results as follows. Foraging is used broadly here, and includes hunting animals, setting traps, and identifying edible plants.

* Critical: Step up the food die.
* Strong: All food die rolls for the rest of the day automatically pass. 
* Weak: The next food die roll automatically passes.
* Miss: Nothing happens.
* Fumble: Encounter.

Encounters while foraging may be particularly dangerous if the character is out alone! Better hope it's a friendly faction. Depending on the result, this may represent the hunter becoming the hunted.

# Camp

Camping lasts two watches. After camping, wise characters may recover all workings. Additionally, each character may roll their hit die and regain that many hit points. If there is bad weather, the recovery roll is made with disadvantage (roll hit die twice and choose lower result).

# Actions at Night

Players must roll the light die with disadvantage for each night watch they perform any actions other than camping.# Dungeon Exploration

**Dungeon exploration** begins when the characters arrive in a dungeon they wish to explore that has a corresponding numbered **grid map** of rooms, passages, doorways, and important features. At least one **encounter** table is also necessary to determine what sorts of beasts and factions may be found in the dungeon.

## Turns and Rooms

During dungeon exploration, time is measured in **turns** of roughly ten minutes. Using a stack of six different colored poker chips is an effective way to track an hour of time (red, black, black, red, black, black). This is intentionally similar to the six watches a day for wilderness exploration, except the first and fourth turns track light instead of food.

Additionally, three poker chips are needed to track the passing of hours. Each time six turns pass, one hour goes by. Track this by placing one poker chip in the hours stack. After the fourth hour, reset the hour tracking and move time forward one watch. Dungeon exploration doesn't typically last much longer than a watch or two, since it tends to deplete resources much quicker than wilderness exploration.

Distance in the dungeon is tracked via **rooms of roughly 1,000 square feet**. This requires some hand waving to use effectively. A long hallway may need to be broken up into multiple rooms, while a set of very small rooms would be considered one room for purposes of exploration time. In most published adventures, any keyed area with a number or a name is probably one room. The important thing is to be aggressive with keeping time moving.

## Wonder

Dungeons have a **wonder rating from 1 to 8.** This reflects how obscure and potentially lucrative the knowledge and valuables located within the dungeon are. It frequently tracks closely with the amount of danger present. Different areas or sections of a larger dungeon may have different levels of wonder.

## Dungeon Exploration Procedure

1. At the start of a new hour, determine **dungeon events**.
2. Spotlight player chooses one of the following actions for the group.
    1. **Explore** a new room, **travel** through already explored rooms, or **search** the current room.
        1. Takes one or two turns, depending on encumbrance.
        2. On the first and fourth turns, **roll the light die**.
    2. **Craft torches** or **rebalance gear**.
        1. One turn.
        2. On the first and fourth turns, **roll the light die**.
    3. **Regroup**.
        1. Takes one watch.
        2. **Roll the light die.**
    4. **Camp**.
        1. Takes two watches.
        2. **Roll the light die.**
3. Track time for the chosen action.
    1. If six turns have passed, mark another hour of time and reset the turns.
    2. If four hours have passed, mark another watch of time and reset the hours.
    3. On every watch, **roll the fellowship die**.
    4. On the first and fourth watch, **roll the food die**.

# Dungeon Events

To determine **dungeon events**, the gamemaster makes a general test, and rolls on the subtable indicated, if necessary.

* Critical: Surprise!
* Strong: Close Encounter.
* Weak: Distant Encounter.
* Miss: None.
* Fumble: Discovery.

## Encounter

Most events in the dungeon are encounters. Each dungeon or section of dungeon will need an encounter table stocked with creatures and factions that may be in the area. Another fun addition to dungeon encounter tables are rival adventuring parties. **Roll a d6** to determine the turn when the encounter will occur.

For **distant** encounters, the characters have plenty of warning before the encounter occurs. The target of the encounter is a few rooms away, and the characters hear them approaching. This is the most common result on the table. It's a way to let the players choose how to handle a coming threat: run away, try to create a barrier, ambush them. It makes for difficult choices if the threat is coming from the direction the players were intending to go.

If there's a **close** encounter, there's no time to react. The creatures have stumbled into the room. The **encounter procedure** should be used to determine how to handle this. In the **surprise** encounter, the creatures or factions were lying in wait for the characters. It's time to fight on.

### Blather

At first blush, this is a fairly high encounter rate. It works better with dungeons that are not packed wall to wall with monsters in every room. The _Dwimmermount_ megadungeon is an excellent example of this philosophy. Having blank space lets the dungeon breathe more, allowing factions to patrol and move around. It also makes it less of a goal to go room by room, trying to clear every chamber of danger, because one of the higher sources for encounters are the random tables for the dungeon. This helps incentivize pushing deeper when the opportunity arises, because returning to the dungeon doesn't mean it's all that much easier to traverse.

## Holding Portals

There are occasions where characters may attempt to seal themselves off in a relatively "safe" portion of the dungeon. Dungeons being what they are, though, this is fraught with peril. If there is an encounter with curious creatures capable of opening or destroying such barriers, **roll the gear die**. If the gear die fails, the barrier does not hold, and the creatures make their way in.

## Discovery

If the party has a discovery, they will stumble upon a valuable. **Roll a d6** to determine the turn when the valuable is found. It should be fairly obvious, since they aren't searching for it. If it's an area of the dungeon already explored, perhaps it is being carried by an explorer who has met an unfortunate end.

The value is based on the wodner of the dungeon where the discovery is made. Make a general test, calculating the value as follows. 

* Critical: Wonder + 2
* Strong: Wonder + 1
* Weak: Wonder
* Miss: Wonder - 1

# Exploration and Travel

The movement in dungeons is similar to that of wilderness, just substituting rooms for hexes and ignoring scout tests. **Exploration** is moving to a new room the characters haven't been to before, which takes **one turn**. When characters **travel** through rooms they have already visited, they may move through **two rooms in one turn**.

## Encumbrance

If one or more characters in the party are encumbered, it takes **two turns to explore** and only **one room may be traveled** through each turn.

## Caution

The default movement rate assumes a fairly high level of caution. When players explore a new room, describe the area with a good amount of detail. This includes any sounds that may be coming from beyond doors or down halls. The standard level of caution assumes that characters are listening carefully, moving somewhat slowly, and generally trying to stay aware of their surroundings. However, they will not automatically find traps or hidden doors or treasures in the room they are in. For that, they must search.

## Running

There are times, particularly when chased by horrible things, that characters care far more about speed than caution. When running, characters move at **double rate**. For example, if they are unencumbered, they can **travel through four rooms** in a turn. Exploration is still slower than travel, even when running, due to dealing with unexpected terrain. Much better to run toward a known entrance than deeper into the dungeon! The rules for chasing are in the encounters section.

# Search

If there is something of interest in the room, it is found. This is commonly used to find secret doors, traps, and treasure. If there are multiple things of interest, only one is found for each turn spent searching. Remember again that room is a general term that includes corridors and hallways!

## Traps

Traps are a common feature of dungeons. If characters search a room for traps, they will find one, provided it is there. Otherwise, most traps allow some sort of success test to avoid them or take less damage. When running, these tests are made with disadvantage.

### Blather

I've never found rolling a die to find things all that interesting. If the players are searching for something, they find it. Time pressure makes constant searching costly.

# Regroup

Regrouping in the dungeon is more restrictive than it is in the wilds. To initiate regrouping, the spotlight player **rolls the light die and the fellowship die**. Regrouping takes an entire watch, but the light die is only rolled once, as staying in place helps to conserve resources. If this is the first or fourth watch of the day, the food die must be rolled as normal.

During regrouping, characters may either **heal** or **memorize a working**. If a player wishes to heal, they gain hit points equal to a roll of the character's hit die.

## Events

Resolve the event rolled at the beginning of the hour during the regroup action. Only one event occurs during regrouping, since there are fewer events when characters aren't moving.

# Camp

Camping is also more restrictive in the dungeon than it is in the wilds. To initiate camping, the spotlight player **rolls the light die once and the fellowship die twice**. Camping takes two watches, but the light die is only rolled once, as it is easier to conserve that resource while not moving. The food die is rolled as normal if either of the watches spent camping are the first or the fourth of the day.

During camping, each character gains hit points equal to a roll of the character's hit die. Additionally, all spellcasters may refresh their workings.

## Events

Resolve the event rolled at the beginning of the hour during the camp action. Additionally, one more event is rolled during camping. It is more dangerous to camp in dungeons!

# Crafting Torches and Rebalancing Gear

As an action that takes one turn, the spotlight player may **step down the gear die to set the light die at a d6**, or **step down the fellowship die to set the gear die at a d6**. This can be done for free while regrouping or camping.TBD# Encounter Procedure

When an **intelligent creature** is first discovered, apply the following procedure.

* Check for starting distance
* Check for surprise
    * Roll Dex, if passed, no surprise
* Choose one approach
    * Communicate
    * Combat
        * Roll usage dice for armor at start of combat
    * Flee
        * Enemy may make free strikes as appropriate
        * A chase ensues

# Communicate

One player may make a Cha test. If there isn't a mutually understandable language, roll with disadvantage. If the characters trade something of value to the other group or have leverage for some reason, roll with advantage. The result determines their feelings toward the party.

* Critical: Friendly
* Complete: Talkative
* Partial: Unsure
* Miss: Unfriendly
* Fumble: Hostile# Combat Procedure

Combat is divided up into rounds, which use the following procedure.

* Declare Actions
    * Melee / Missile / Spell
* Check Initiative (Dex Test)
    * If passed, character is quick, otherwise they are slow
* Quick Actions
* Enemy Actions
    * Slow characters using missile or spells may be interrupted if damaged
    * Players roll to defend, although the GM rolls for monster damage or effects
* Slow Actions
* Morale Check
    * Single Enemy: First hit, 1/2 hp lost, 3/4 hp lost
    * Group: First casualty, 1/2 dead, 3/4 dead

Actions are chosen from the list below. In general, movement is possible in addition to an action. This list of actions is not exhaustive - using items (potions, rings, scrolls, wands) and other special abilities may qualify.

## Armor

Armor dice are **rolled as needed** (don't roll armor dice at the start of combat). Once rolled, the value may decrease during the combat procedure as blows are taken. Enemies do not roll for armor - they have fixed value listed in the stat block.

## Melee

Test Strength.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Strong: Bypass armor
* Weak: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Exertion (lower armor die value, to a minimum of one)
   * Exposed position
* Miss: Miss
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Missile

Test Dexterity.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Strong: Bypass armor
* Weak: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Ammo check (ammunition usage)
   * Exposed position
* Miss: Miss
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Defend

Used whenever an enemy makes a physically damaging attack. This is a player facing game, so the player rolls. Test Constitution.

* Critical: No damage and next attack against enemy gains advantage
* Strong: No damage
* Weak: Subtract armor from damage, then lower armor die by one
    * Armor may not lower below a 1
* Miss: Full damage
* Fumble: Enemy does double damage

## Spell

Test Int

* Critical: Double effect and keep spell
* Strong: Effect and keep spell
* Weak: Effect and lose spell
* Miss: No effect and lose spell
* Fumble: Magical mishap

## After Combat

Any armor dice showing a 1 must make a usage test using the die. A failure degrades the armor one step. Note the damaged value of the armor in the equipment section.# Factions

Since trade is one of the most important parts of _Lavendar Hack_, it makes sense that there must be groups to trade _with_. That's where factions come in. Factions are the various groups large and small that characters might encounter while far away from home. The characters' home is special, and is covered under the rules for **downtime**.

Factions are not necessarily composed entirely of one culture. The diversity of a faction, along with various cultural norms and practices, is independent of the characteristics used to describe them. For each faction in the game, figure out their **disposition**, **approach**, **languages**, types of goods they **supply** and **demand**, and what the faction **wants**.

## Disposition

The most important characteristic of a faction is their disposition toward the characters, measured as a value from 0 (openly hostile) to 10 (very friendly). Disposition is on the same scale as value, as they are interrelated. Over the course of a campaign, disposition may raise or lower based on the activity of the characters and other forces.

A faction with a disposition of 0 has no interest in interacting the the characters at all, unless the intention is to imprison or injure them, while a faction with a disposition of 10 are certainly more welcoming of the characters than the people of their own home.

| Disposition | Attitude |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Hostile |
| 2-3 | Unfriendly |
| 4-5 | Uncertain |
| 6-7 | Indifferent |
| 8-9 | Friendly |
| 10 | Enthusiastic |

## Approach

Factions have different ways they prefer to interact with others. This is characterized with an approach, which is either **rapport**, **command**, **intimidation**, or **logic**. Each faction has one favored approach.

## Languages

Each faction also has one or more languages they are capable of conversing in. If characters don't know the language of the faction, that can make interactions with them much more difficult.

## Supply and Demand

Different cultures have very different ideas of value, whether driven by preference or scarcity. If a culture supplies a certain type of valuable (such as potions), its value is **one less** in all interactions with the faction. If a culture demands a certain type of valuable, its value is worth **one more** in interactions with the faction. Naturally, it's worth giving a culture what they demand and getting what a culture supplies! A faction may supply or demand any number of types of things, or none at all.

## Wants

Factions always have things they want. These might be tasks, such as opening a road, or stopping the attacks by the undead. They can also be valuables, such as a cockatrice feather or a bar made of platinum. The valuables wanted by a faction don't necessarily need to be worth a great amount, but they should be fairly hard to come by. Although it's _okay_ to have a faction want something like 10,000 copper pennies, that's a little boring. Helping the faction get what they want improves their disposition.

# Downtime

A faction that has a disposition of 8 or higher (friendly or better) may be used as a downtime location by characters.# Court

When the players wish to **court a faction**, the characters must be at a location the faction controls, with important characters from the faction present, and the faction must have a disposition of 1 or higher. Furthermore, the characters may only court a faction **once between each downtime** procedure.

If a faction has a disposition of 0, the characters must get their foot in the door somehow, perhaps by offering a bribe of some sort or using magical abilities. Shifting a faction from a disposition of 0 to a disposition of 1 shouldn't be easy, as this faction either wants absolutely nothing to do with the characters, or more likely, is intent on causing them harm.

This procedure is not used when characters return home. That is covered under **downtime**.

### Blather

I struggled on what to call this procedure, but liked the word court, since it has multiple applicable connotations. Community was another option, but court is also a verb, which fits in better with combat, exploration, and chase. Court doesn't necessarily mean a formal medieval audience with royalty. The usage of court to mean "to persuade or win over" is also applicable, as any faction may be courted.

## Courting a Faction Procedure

1. Set fellowship die to the max value for the die type.
2. Create goals.
3. One player who hasn't gone this round chooses an action:
    1. Pursue goals.
    2. Trade.
    3. Curry favor.
4. One day of time passes.
5. Lower fellowship die value by one.
    1. If the fellowship die value is greater than 1, players _may_ return to step 3.
    2. Actions are taken in rounds where each player acts once. Players may choose the order of actions each round.
6. Court ends immediately if the players so choose or the fellowship die value is a 1.

# Goals

Goals are written from the perspective of characters. They are things the characters want, such as "let us pass through the Eastern gate", "release Xendar from prison", or "let us view the Rotting Hand Scroll". They are not things of value, such as gear or resources. Those items are covered under trading. Write goals down on different index cards, also noting the difficulty for the goal.

## Goal Difficulties

Goals all have difficulties, which range from 3-12, representing how likely it is the faction is to do the thing. The disposition of the faction should be taken into account when setting difficulties. Goal difficulties of 1-2 aren't used both because the math doesn't work well and goals should represent things which require _some_ measure of convincing. Goals with a difficulty of 12 are going to be very, very hard to achieve, even if the party has a high fellowship die.

## Goal Progress

Progress toward a goal is tracked on the card. When a goal has an amount of progress equal to or greater than the difficulty, it is achieved. Remove the goal from play and narrate any consequences from achieving the goal.

## Starting Goals

At the start of court, write down some appropriate goals. This can and should be a collaborative effort, with all of the players contributing ideas. Goals which weren't achieved on previous visits to court may also be recycled if they're still appropriate.

# Pursue Goals

When a character is in the presence of an influential member of a faction, they may **pursue a goal** with that faction. The player chooses a goal and chooses which ability score to test based on the approach they take. The choices for approach are **rapport (Cha)**, **command (Wis)**, **intimidation (Con)**, or **logic (Int)**. The approach should color the nature of the interaction. **Test Cha / Wis / Con / Int:**

* Critical: +3 progress
* Strong: +2 progress
* Weak: +1 progress
* Miss: None
* Fumble: Incident! Lower the faction disposition by one.

If the approach used is the **favored approach** for the faction, **add one** additional progress to a goal on a success. A miss is still a miss.

## Incidents

An incident represents a social faux pas of some significant severity. If the faction has a disposition of 1 and an incident occurs, the characters are about to be imprisoned or killed. The combat and chase procedures may be appropriate now! Things are about to get out of hand.

# Trade

When a character is in the presence of someone from a faction who has the types of goods or services they want, they may offer up something of value and specify what they want in return to **make a trade** with the faction. The item on offer is removed from the character sheet. The character receives something equal or less in value (see note on maximum value below), modified by a **Cha Test:**

* Critical: +2 value
* Strong: +1 value
* Weak: +0 value
* Miss: -1 value
* Fumble: -2 value

The character may trade for **valuables**, **resources**, or **rumors** the faction would reasonably be able to provide. Remember to modify valuables appropriately based on what the faction supplies or demands.

For resources, the die type gained is equal to twice the value (see [Valuables](VALUABLES.md)), with a max die type of d12. For example, a value 5 sets the die to a d10. If the fellowship die is improved, swap out the die type, but don't change the top facing number, since that tracks turns. Gaining fellowship resources represents carousing and revelry.

Rumors traded for are given a rough worth equal to how common the knowledge is. This is going to be very coarse, but value one rumors are fairly common knowledge like "where's an inn", while value ten rumors might be "the true name to bind Ungrax, lord of demons".

## Maximum Value

The **maximum value** that can be gained from a faction is equal to their **disposition**. Anything above that is wasted. Hostile forces don't set you up with premium gear.

## Trading Down

As mentioned in [Valuables](VALUABLES.md), when trading for valuables, a character may take five slots worth of something one lower in value.

## Example

Wendy is playing _Yargrel the Crafty_ and the fellowship die is currently a d6. The party is visiting the centaurs of North Hollow (disposition 5), and she offers up wyvern poison (value 4) for food, drink, and good conversation (gaining a better fellowship die). The centaurs have a demand for wyvern poison, so the value is increased to 5. The Cha test results in a natural 20! Critical! The final value is now a 7.

However, the max value is a 5 because the centaur disposition is a 5. So, the fellowship die is swapped out for a d10 (twice the result). Even if the disposition with the centaurs had been higher, only a value 6 could have been used, because the d12 is the highest resource die. Still much better than a d6!

### Blather

The _Centaurs Demand Wyvern Poison_ is also the name of my stoner rock filk band.

# Curry Favor

When a character is in the presence of an influential member of a faction, and they have satisfied one of the factions wants, they may **curry favor** with that faction. Increase the disposition of the faction by one.# Downtime

**Downtime** begins when the characters arrive back at a comparatively safe populated locale that functions as their long term base of operations. Downtime is primarily an opportunity to turn valuables into experience, although it is also the time to research mysteries or craft items. Time during downtime is measured in **weeks**, with downtime taking at least one week, and possibly more, depending on how many weeks the players spend performing downtime actions.

## Wealth

There is a wealth table on the party sheet. This reflects the various sorts of investments and connections that the party has available to them. When downtime begins, items of known value are erased from character sheets and the values are tallied on the wealth table by filling in boxes. During downtime, the wealth table may be spent from to accomplish different actions, by spending (erasing) the boxes of the desired values.

There are five boxes on each row of the wealth table. This is to reflect the rough 5:1 ratio of the value scale (see [_Valuables_](VALUABLES.md)). When **five boxes** of a row are filled in, they may be erased, and **one box of the higher value** is filled in.

## Liquidity

It is possible to trade down on the wealth table, but the rate is worse than trading up. Flexibility costs money! **Erasing one box** on the wealth table lets a player fill in **four boxes of the lower value**.

## Spending

To **spend wealth**, simply erase the box of the given value. For example, to spend wealth 2, erase a box on the second row of the wealth table. Players may move wealth up or down as detailed above before doing so.

## Downtime Procedure

1. Bank known valuables.
   1. One week of time passes.
2. If the players wish to stay in town, they must choose one of the following downtime actions.
   1. **Train**, **craft**, **research**, **bank**, or **carouse**.
   2. One week of time passes.
   3. Repeat step 2.
3. When the players are ready to end downtime, they must pay cost of living.
   1. Set resource dice based on value of payment.
      1. Less than half of level: d4s
      2. Less than level: d6s
      3. Equal to level: d8s
      4. Higher than level: d10s

# Banking Valuables

At the start of downtime, any valuables of known value (see [_Valuables_](VALUABLES.md)) may be tallied and banked. For each valuable that is banked, it is erased from the character sheet, and one tally is marked on the appropriate row of the wealth table on the party sheet. If any row of the wealth table is completely filled with five marks, the row may be erased and one higher value tally is marked.

Items of unknown value must be **researched** first to determine their worth. Items of known value don't have to be banked, but it is the only way to remove them from a character sheet. Additionally, the only time items may be banked in bulk is at the beginning of downtime.

# Progress

Training and crafting require progress. There are progress tracks on the character sheet. Each step of a progress track has a value equal to the step number. The first box on a progress track has a value of one, the second box on a progress track has a value of two, and so on.

Making progress requires wealth. In order to fill in a progress box, a player must erase a box with the equivalent value from the wealth table. For example, a wealth of three must be spent to fill in the third progress box. The progress boxes must be tallied in order.

# Training

Training is the process of gathering experience and resources necessary for leveling up. It takes an amount of progress equal to the target level. For example, a 3rd level character needs four progress to reach level 4. Reaching level 4 would require 4 weeks of downtime, along with spending wealth of value 1, 2, 3, and 4 in that order. All of the progress doesn't need to be tallied in one session of downtime. This is particularly difficult at higher levels.

## Level Up Procedure

When the progress box equal to the target level is filled in, the character levels up. Complete the following steps.

1. The player may increase either (choose one) primary ability score by one.
2. Roll a number of hit dice equal to new level and add them together.
   1. Add Con to each roll.
   2. If the total is higher than the character's maximum hit points, use new result as maximum.
3. Note any new class abilities.

# Crafting

The mechanics of crafting are the same as training, but crafting is used to create new items rather than gain experience. The sorts of items a character may craft are restricted based on class. The Wise may craft scrolls, wands, staves. The Strong may craft arms and armor. The Deft may craft rings, bows, and clothing. See the [_MAGIC ITEMS_](ITEMS.md) section for more details.

# Research

Researching is the way to find the actual value of things, as well as the properties of magical items. For a week of research, a player needs to spend wealth 2. After spending wealth, they may ask a question about an item. Players may either determine the **value** of an item or a **magical property** of an item. A Wise character knows if an item is magical or not (see [_Wise_](WISE.md)). The gamemaster tells players when the last magical property of an item is discovered.

## Maps

TBD - Maps should be able to be converted into wealth?

## Mysteries

TBD - Information and secrets found while explorting should be able to be converted into wealth?

# Bank

Valuables may be banked later in downtime, but it takes a week of downtime, and spending 1 wealth. Still, this is the only way to bank valuables during the same downtime phase in which they were researched.

# Carouse

To initiate carousing, a player spends wealth 2 and makes a **Cha test** for their character.

* Critical: Map
* Strong: Two Rumors
* Weak: Rumor
* Miss: Nothing
* Fumble: Fight!

# Cost of Living

When the players choose to end downtime, or run out of funds with which to conduct actions, they must pay cost of living before heading out into the wilds. The cost of living is based on the character with the **highest** level in the party. The higher the level, the more accustomed to a higher standard of living! At least **1 wealth** must be spent if it is available.

## End of Downtime Resource Dice

Depending on the value spent, the four resource dice (food, fellowship, gear, and light) are set appropriately. Then the characters are ready to continue exploration!

* Nothing: d20s
* Less than half of level (round down): d4s
* Less than level: d6s
* Equal to level: d8s
* Higher than level: d10sTBDTBDTBD# Solo Play

# Enemies

Most B/X style enemy stat blocks are appropriate for this game. The big difference is AC. Instead use armor value from 0-6 as appropriate.TBD
