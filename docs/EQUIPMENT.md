# Equipment

The only things written into slots on character sheets are valuables. Valuables which have some use other than just for value are referred to as equipment. These are things like weapons, armor, useful plants, parts of beasts, and magic items. General sorts of equipment, like tents and sleeping bags, are covered by the gear die.

# Weapons

Weapons additionally have a damage die, which is used during combat.

| Name | Damage | Value | Slots | Effects | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dagger | d4 | 3 | 1  |
| Shortsword | d6 | 3 | 1  |
| Longsword | d8 | 4 |  2 |
| Mace | d8 | 3 |  1 |
| Greatsword | d10 | 5 | 2 | Two Handed, Slow |  |
| Shortbow | d6 | 3 | 1 | Two Handed | Short |
| Longbow | d8 | 4 | 2 | Two Handed | Long |
| Crossbow | d10 | 4 | 2 | Two Handed, Slow | Long |
| Pistol | d10 | 6 | 1 | Gunpowder | Short |

Characters using slow weapons will always take slow actions during the combat procedure (don't roll initiative).

For various reasons, weapons can become less effective. If this happens, lower the damage die as if it was a usage die (d8 to d6, d6 to d4, etc). Record the new damage dice amount on the character sheet next to the original damage.

# Armor

Armor dice are used during combat, informing the players of how effective their armor is.

| Name | Protection | Value | Slots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Leather | d4 | 4 | 1 |
| Chain | d6 | 5 | 2 |
| Half Plate | d8 | 6 | 3 |
| Full Plate | d10 | 7 | 3 |
| Shield | +1 Step | 4 | 1 |

Note: A shield steps up the armor die once, in a similar fashion to a usage die. For example, leather and a shield is a d6 armor die. Armor, like weapons, can also become damaged.
