# Lavender Hack

This document will eventually be broken out into multiple sections. For now, though, it is consolidated here. This is mostly based on _B/X Essentials_, so use that to fill in gaps. The big difference is that there are standard player facing results: 8+ for success with cost and 18+ for complete success, rather than having varying difficulty numbers. Resource management is also a big feature.

# Core Mechanics

The core mechanic for Lavender Hack is a player facing d20 system. Most rolls use one of six standard attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma. You roll the d20, add an ability modifier, and compare against a fixed set of results. These attributes are on the 3-18 scale, and have the same bonuses as in B/X D&D.

* 18: +3
* 16-17: +2
* 13-15: +1
* 9-12: +0
* 6-8: -1
* 4-5: -2
* 3: -3

Rolling to accomplish something using one of these attributes is called a *test*. If the final tally (d20 roll plus attribute modifier) is an 8 or higher, the test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. Frequently procedures need finer granularity beyond success and failure. In that case, the following degrees of success may be used.

* Natural 20: Critical Success
* 18+: Complete Success
* 8+: Partial Success / Success with Cost
* 7-: Miss
* Natural 1: Fumble

The “natural” language above references a d20 test roll that shows the number in question, regardless of modifiers.

## Advantage/Disadvantage

Some situations can result in a test roll having *advantage* or *disadvantage*. If a player has advantage on a test, they roll two dice and take the result they wish. If they have disadvantage, they roll two dice and the GM takes the result they wish. This frequently applies to tests, but could apply to any other rolls, such as damage or usage, as appropriate.

## Bonuses/Penalties

There are certain situations where bonuses and penalties are applied to a test roll. These are just additional modifiers added to the result. The main source of bonuses and penlties are attributes. No test roll may have a bonus higher than +5 for any reason.

## Usage Dice

These are taken from _Black Hack_, although 1-3 is a downgrade. These are used to track resources or items which can be damaged, like armor. The dice degrade from (d12 --> d10 --> d8 --> d6 --> d4 --> Broken / Used Up) each time 1-3 is rolled or a specific effect calls for it.

| Usage Die | Value | Approximate Worth
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

# Level Up Procedure

* Roll d20 with advantage and compare to favored attribute. If higher, increase attribute by one.
* Choose any attribute, roll d20 and compare. If higher, increase attribute by one.
* Roll a number of hit dice equal to new level. If higher than current hit points, use new amount.
* Note any new class abilities.

# Equipment

Use _Knave_ prices for now - copper piece standard!

## Weapon Damage

* d6 Short sword, staff, club, short bow
* d8 Sword, mace, spear, polearm, axe, longbow, crossbow, pistol
* d10 Greatsword, battle axe, lance, flail, musket, heavy crossbow

For various reasons, weapons can become less effective. In this case, lower the damage die as if it was a usage die (d8 to d6, d6 to d4, etc).

## Armor Usage

Armor usage dice are used during combat, informing the players of how effective their armor is.

* dU4 Leather
* dU6 Studded leather, ring, scale
* dU8 Chain, half-plate
* dU10 Full plate with helmet

Note: A shield steps up the usage die once.

## Resources

* dU6 Torches, spikes
* dU8 Arrows, oil, mule, rope

# Encounter

* Check for range
* Check for surprise
    * Dex checks, if passed, no surprise
* Choose approach
    * Communicate
    * Combat
        * Roll usage dice for armor at start of combat
    * Flee
        * Enemy may make free strikes as appropriate
        * A chase ensues

# Communicate

One player may make a Cha test. If there isn't a mutually understandable language, roll with disadvantage. If the characters trade something of value to the other group or have leverage for some reason, roll with advantage.

* Critical: Friendly
* Complete: Talkative
* Partial: Unsure
* Miss: Unfriendly
* Fumble: Hostile

# Combat

Combat is divided up into rounds, which use the following procedure.

* Declare Actions
    * Melee / Missile / Spell
* Check Initiative (Dex Test)
    * If passed, character is quick, otherwise they are slow
* Quick Actions
* Enemy Actions
    * Slow characters using missile or spells may be interrupted if damaged
    * Players roll to defend, although the GM rolls for monster damage or effects
* Slow Actions
* Morale Check
    * Single Enemy: First hit, 1/2 hp lost, 3/4 hp lost
    * Group: First casualty, 1/2 dead, 3/4 dead

Actions are chosen from the list below. In general, movement is possible in addition to an action. This list of actions is not exhaustive - using items (potions, rings, scrolls, wands) and other special abilities (turning) may qualify. If possible, actions should be made to fit the critical / complete / partial / fumble framework.

## Armor

Armor dice are rolled as needed (don't roll all the armor dice at the start of combat). Once rolled, the value is set for the duration of the combat. Enemies do not roll for armor - they have fixed value listed in the stat block.

## Melee

Test Strength.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Complete: Bypass armor
* Partial: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Exertion (lower armor die value, to a minimum of one)
   * Exposed position
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Missile

Test Dexterity.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Complete: Bypass armor
* Partial: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Ammo check (ammunition usage)
   * Exposed position
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Defend

Used whenever an enemy makes a physically damaging attack. This is a player facing game, so the player rolls. Test Constitution.

* Critical: No damage and enemy is in an exposed position
* Complete: No damage
* Partial: Subtract armor from damage, but lower armor value by one
    * For example, if a player rolls a 5 for chain mail at the start of combat, it is now a 4
    * Armor may not lower below a 1
* Fail: Full damage
* Fumble: Enemy does double damage

## Spell

Test Int (wizards) or Wis (clerics)

* Critical: Double effect and keep spell
* Complete: Effect and keep spell
* Partial: Effect and lose spell
* Fumble: Lose spell

## After Combat

Any armor dice showing a 1 must make a usage test. A failure degrades the armor one step.

# General Tests and Saves

For most tests and saves, just use success (8+) or failure. If a player has an appropriate background for the test, they get advantage.

# Adventure

Each day is divided into four hour watches, for a total of six watches each day (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night). For each watch, choose one: explore, move, or rest. The procedures are slightly different if characters are in a dungeon or wilderness.

## End of Watch

* Check for encounters
* Resource usage dice as appropriate
    * Torches, rope, spikes, etc
* Dusk only
    * Spend one food
* Dawn only
    * Spellcasters memorize spells if they rested for two watches

## Wilderness

* Explore
    * Find something in the hex, if it's there
* Move
    * Attempt to move to an adjacent hex
    * Check for getting lost
        * Scout makes a Wis check
        * If failed, lose a day, return to where you are
* Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die and regain that many hit points
    * Repair. Spend repair cost and test to repair armor or weapon (Con), on success, improve usage die up to max
    * Memorize. Test to memorize spell (Int) / beseech prayer (Wis), on success, gain one spell or prayer up to max
    * Forage. Test (Wis)
        * Complete: gain one food or random herb / plant of interest
        * Partial: food is rotten or comprimised in some way
        * Failure: encounter

## Dungeon

At the end of each watch in the dungeon, test any usage die for light sources or other equipment used.

* Explore
    * Slow, cautious, movement
    * May carefully search up to *four* medium sized rooms
        * Find something of interest in each room, if it exists
    * Gain advantage if traps are triggered
* Move
    * Move quickly without searching
        * Also for fleeing
    * May cover three times as much ground as exploration
    * Automatically surprised and disadvantage if traps are triggered
* Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die with disadvantage and regain that many hit points
    * Memorize. Test to learn spell or prayer (Int/Wis) with disadvantage, on success, gain one spell or prayer

# Enemies

Most B/X style enemy stat blocks are appropriate for this game. The big difference is AC. Instead use armor value from 0-6 as appropriate. If not sure, an armor of 1 or 2 is best.

# Experience Points

* One XP for each silver piece worth of treasure recovered
* 1000 XP for each dangerous hex explored
* 2000 XP for each dangerous dungeon explored
