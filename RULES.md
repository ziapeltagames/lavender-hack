# Lavender Hack

Welcome to _Lavender Hack_ (_LHC_)! This is a role-playing game based on a variety of games from the [Old School Renaissance](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/1144/what-defines-the-old-school-renaissance) and the principal of **strict time records**. However, it incorporates some very new school ideas, such as success with cost and abstract but well integrated resource management.

Note: yes, this is one crazy big doc. I'm iterating enough that it makes it easier to make changes in this format. Eventually I'll divide it up into different docs for different topics. Or maybe not. It is github after all. I dunno. Ctrl+F?

### Blather

Hi! I'm Phil Lewis. I wrote some of this and stole the rest. The big influences are [_Whitehack_](https://whitehackrpg.wordpress.com/), [_Black Hack_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition), [_Macchiato Monsters_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264169/Macchiato-Monsters), [_Dungeon Crawl Classics_](http://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/), _Czege House Rules_, [_Knave_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave), _Dreams of Adventure_, [_Dungeon World_](https://dungeon-world.com/), _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons_, and [_Old School Essentials_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/272802/OldSchool-Essentials-Basic-Rules). I'm going to use these sections to rant and ramble and add more context. Skip them if you're just looking for rules.

"Strict Time Records" is a Gygaxian reference to the first edition [_Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17004/Dungeon-Masters-Guide-1e) beseeching Dungeon Masters to use time pressure effectively. Way back in the mid 1980s, I found this idea fun in theory, but cumbersome in practice. One of the core goals of this system is to make that time pressure concept central to the game while keeping the fiddly bits manageable and meaningful. That's kind of my jam. I wrote another game called [_Wrath of the Autarch_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/191025/Wrath-of-the-Autarch) which is fun if you want a really deep dive on domain management.

There is also a goal to hew somewhat close to a [B/X](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) core so I can use OSR content like [_Barrowmaze_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/139762/Barrowmaze-Complete) or [_Hot Springs Island_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/215340/The-Dark-of-Hot-Springs-Island) or [_Night's Dark Terror_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17119/B10-Nights-Dark-Terror-Basic) without too much pain.

This game itself probably doesn't fit into the OSR, but if you use B/X to cover up any holes (of which there are many), you'll probably be in pretty good shape. It also might go without saying, but you need to understand RPGs and B/X to make sense of this. If you're completely new, get started with _5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons_ and come back after you've played a few games.

# Core Mechanics

The core mechanic for _Lavender Hack_ is a player facing d20 (twenty sided die) system. Most rolls use a modifier based on one of six standard attributes: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Wisdom (Wis), Intelligence (Int), Constitution (Con), and Charisma (Cha). You roll the d20, add the related attribute modifier (which could be negative), and compare the total against a fixed set of results. These attributes start on the 3-18 scale, and have the same bonuses and penalties as in B/X D&D.

## Attribute Range

* 20: +5
* 19: +4
* 18: +3
* 16-17: +2
* 13-15: +1
* 9-12: +0
* 6-8: -1
* 4-5: -2
* 3: -3

Note that if the game says something like **add Con** or **plus Str**, that always means the attribute modifier, never the original attribute.

## Tests

Rolling to accomplish something using one of these attributes is called a **test**. A d20 is rolled and usually an attribute modifier is added. If the final tally (d20 roll plus attribute modifier) is an **8 or higher**, the test **succeeds**. Tests are specified like **roll Str** or **roll Cha**. Frequently, finer granularity is needed beyond just determining success. In that case, the following degrees of success are used.

* Natural 20: **Critical** Success
* 18+: **Complete** Success
* 8+: **Partial** Success / Success with Cost
* 7-: **Miss** / Complication
* Natural 1: **Fumble**

The **natural** above refers to a d20 test roll that shows the number in question, regardless of modifiers. For example, if you're making a Strength test with a +2 modifier to the roll, and the roll shows an 18, that is not a critical even though the total is a 20.

### Blather

I really wanted to keep the widely known d20 interpretations of 1 as a fumble or massive failure and 20 as a critical success. It's easier to ~~trick~~ persuade people into playing.

## Advantage/Disadvantage

Some situations can result in a test roll having **advantage** or **disadvantage**. If a player has advantage on a test, they roll two dice and take the result they wish. If they have disadvantage, they roll two dice and the GM takes the result they wish. This frequently applies to tests (d20 rolls), but could apply to any other dice rolls (of any dice type) as specified. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.

## Bonuses/Penalties

There are certain situations where bonuses and penalties are applied to a test roll. These are just additional modifiers added to the result. The main source of bonuses and penalties are attributes.

# Procedures and Moves

_LHC_ uses a variety of **procedures**, which are sets of steps used to handle situations that occur in the game. Procedures tend to be more tactical and turn based in nature. Combat is one example of a procedure, as is overland exploration.

**Moves** are narrative and mechanical results that occur when triggered by specific fictional situations. The name of a move is typically in bold, and there is commonly a test involved, along with different results that reflect the nature of the move. Moves might be part of a procedure, or they can stand alone, triggered when the fiction in the game matches the description of the move.

Essentially, procedures tie together sequences of moves, typically in a turn based format, and make it part of a mini-game. Such as using a **melee attack** move in combat. However, moves can stand alone, and be referenced when the fiction calls for it, such as **carousing in town** when you spend funds to party it up. When moves stand alone, there is more latitude in interpreting the results. A 7- isn't so much about failing to do a thing as it is the level of complication and fallout that occurs.

### Blather

Moves come from [_Apocalypse World_](http://apocalypse-world.com/), which burst forth on the RPG scene in 2010 and certainly had a major impact on game design. There are quite a few PbtA (Powered by the Apocalypse) games which leverage, to varying degrees of success, the tech from _Apocalypse World_.

For myself, I like the idea of moves as these mechanical widgets which can push the fiction in all sorts of interesting directions. However, when games are built of nothing but those, I tend to get bored. I like structured mini-games as well, such as Duel of Wits in [_Burning Wheel_](https://www.burningwheel.com/) or combat in [_The One Ring_](http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/the-one-ring/). The purists might blanch at this approach, but I see no incompatibility from mixing the "talk in the funny voices" parts of rpgs with the "win at a game" parts of rpgs.

# Usage Dice

Usage dice are a general purpose tracking mechanism. They're used for **resources**, **food**, and **light**, as well as to track more abstract concepts like **fatigue** and party **discord**. The dice form a ladder of sorts, going from highest to lowest: **d12 <--> d10 <--> d8 <--> d6 <--> d4 <--> Broken / Used / Gone**.

If the rules instruct you to **raise** a usage die, you increase the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped out with a d10. If the rules instruct you to **lower** a usage die, you lower the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped with a d6. There are a variety of ways and reasons usage dice are raised and lowered. A d12 can't be raised and a d4 which is lowered is removed, that thing now being used up, broken, or gone.

## Rolling Usage Dice

Usage dice might be rolled for a variety of reasons. If the result of rolling a usage die is a **1-3**, the die is lowered one step. The more they're used, the more they're used up!

### Blather

Usage dice come from the game [_Black Hack_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition), although they are also used very effectively and extensively in [_Macchiato Monsters_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264169/Macchiato-Monsters). Note that in _Black Hack_ they lower on a 1-2. I used the _MM_ version, which is where the 1-3 comes from.

I love the concept, although getting them to function well as an economy is one of the most active parts of development. Who knows, maybe they won't be as good of a fit as simple counters. It certainly requires a decent amount of rolling to make them viable.

# Party Sheet

There is a party sheet for all the players which tracks four important party level concepts, each tracked with a different usage die. They are **resources**, **discord**, **food**, and **light**.

## Resource

The resource usage die tracks just that, resources the party has available. These are things like blankets, backpacks, oil flasks, lockpicks, writing ink, spellbooks, and large burlap sacks. In short, most everything the well equipped adventurer needs. The higher the die type, the better the quality and quantity of resources. Different class abilities can use the resources die.

### Blather

There tends to be lots of assorted gear that players track on their character sheets. Most of it is very similar and creates overhead without much interest. The resource die abstracts all of that out. In essence, the only items tracked by players tend to be weapons, swords, treasure, and very unique items. This fits in well with an abstract weight system, since there isn't as much to track, the assumption being you're already weighed down by stuff not on your character sheet.

The resource die also provides an interesting mechanism for different classes to exploit narratively. For example, thieves might be able to use it to make a trap, warriors can use it to fix broken armor, and spellcasters can use it for better spell components.

## Food and Light

Food and light are tracked indepently from resources, since they function more as timers during travel. The exploration section details these more.

## Discord

Discord represents party cohesion. If the group is happy, well rested, and ready to go, the discord die is not present. It is raised during stressful situations and can impact various moves negatively, particularly trade and other social situations. It is special in that when it is rolled, it is **not lowered** unless specifically indicated.

# Characters

_LHC_ uses four classes, each of which is a broad archetype: **Strong**, **Wise**, **Deft**, and **Weird**. The classes map roughly to the B/X idea of warriors, spellcasters, rogues, and weird... doesn't map. The classes also have favored attributes: Strong use Strength and Constitution, Wise use Intelligence and Wisdom, Deft use Dexterity and Charisma, and Weird are... weird.

### Blather

Those class names are from _Whitehack_. Still undecided on going that route rather than the more standard class names.

## Backgrounds and Connections

Each character has a background which helps to define them. If the background is relevant to a test, the player may gain advantage on the test roll. However, utilizing a background potentially requires the right gear, so if the result is a partial success, the resource die must be rolled (again if partial success already requires a resource roll).

Suggestion: Can use occupations from _Into the Odd_ page 36 or from _Dungeon Crawl Classics_ page 22. Then roll a connection (player to your left) from _Into the Odd_ page 37.

To-do: Create some tables to flesh out relationships and traits. Maybe this is on a per class basis?

### Blather

This is a substitute for a skill system. It's useful to create a focused and interesting background, which isn't an easy skill to develop. If a background is too broad it can feel watered down, but if it's hyper focused, it may never feel applicable.

## Character Creation

* Roll 3d6 in order for Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma
    * Record attribute modifiers
* Roll or create a background
* Choose a class (Strong, Wise, Deft, Weird)

## Resource Die

The Weird can't use the resource die.

## Starting Equipment

1. Willow Wand
2. Robe of Shimmer
3. Deathcat

# Equipment

## Value

The game uses an abstract concept of **value**. Items and gear are sorted into six broad categories, each of exponential worth. Occasionally it is necessary to compare a usage die to this scale, as given in the table below. _LHC_ uses a copper penny standard for currency, when there is currency, which isn't often. Instead, value tends to be very relative to different groups and cultures.

| Usage Die | Value | Class | Copper Pennies | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | 1 | Beggar | 10 | Sack of Potatoes |
| d4 | 2 | Peasant | 100 | Dagger |
| d6 | 3 | Squire | 1,000 | Broadsword |
| d8 | 4 | Knight | 10,000 | Platemail Armor |
| d10 | 5 | Noble | 100,0000 | Manor House |
| d12 | 6 | Royal | 1,000,000 | Keep |

## Weapons

* d4 Dagger, knife, dart, sling
* d6 Short sword, staff, club, short bow
* d8 Sword, mace, spear, axe, longbow, crossbow, pistol
* d10 **Greatsword**, **claymore**, **battle axe**, **lance**, **halberd**, **flail**, musket, **heavy crossbow**

Weapons in bold are slow and powerful. The player will always take slow actions during initiative (don't roll initiative).

For various reasons, weapons can become less effective. If this happens, lower the damage die as if it was a usage die (d8 to d6, d6 to d4, etc). Record the new damage dice amount on the character sheet next to the original damage.

## Armor

Armor dice are used during combat, informing the players of how effective their armor is.

* Shield (+1 Step)
* d4 Leather
* d6 Chain
* d8 Half plate
* d10 Full plate

Note: A shield steps up the armor die once, in a similar fashion to a usage die. For example, leather and a shield is a d6 armor die. Armor, like weapons, can also become damaged.

# Encounter Procedure

When a **sentient being** is first discovered, apply the following procedure.

* Check for starting distance
* Check for surprise
    * Roll Dex, if passed, no surprise
* Choose one approach
    * Communicate
    * Combat
        * Roll usage dice for armor at start of combat
    * Flee
        * Enemy may make free strikes as appropriate
        * A chase ensues

# Communicate

One player may make a Cha test. If there isn't a mutually understandable language, roll with disadvantage. If the characters trade something of value to the other group or have leverage for some reason, roll with advantage.

* Critical: Friendly
* Complete: Talkative
* Partial: Unsure
* Miss: Unfriendly
* Fumble: Hostile

# Combat Procedure

Combat is divided up into rounds, which use the following procedure.

* Declare Actions
    * Melee / Missile / Spell
* Check Initiative (Dex Test)
    * If passed, character is quick, otherwise they are slow
* Quick Actions
* Enemy Actions
    * Slow characters using missile or spells may be interrupted if damaged
    * Players roll to defend, although the GM rolls for monster damage or effects
* Slow Actions
* Morale Check
    * Single Enemy: First hit, 1/2 hp lost, 3/4 hp lost
    * Group: First casualty, 1/2 dead, 3/4 dead

Actions are chosen from the list below. In general, movement is possible in addition to an action. This list of actions is not exhaustive - using items (potions, rings, scrolls, wands) and other special abilities may qualify.

## Armor

Armor dice are rolled as needed (don't roll all the armor dice at the start of combat). Once rolled, the value is set for the duration of the combat. Enemies do not roll for armor - they have fixed value listed in the stat block.

## Melee

Test Strength.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Complete: Bypass armor
* Partial: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Exertion (lower armor die value, to a minimum of one)
   * Exposed position
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Missile

Test Dexterity.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Complete: Bypass armor
* Partial: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Ammo check (ammunition usage)
   * Exposed position
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Defend

Used whenever an enemy makes a physically damaging attack. This is a player facing game, so the player rolls. Test Constitution.

* Critical: No damage and next attack against enemy gains advantage
* Complete: No damage
* Partial: Subtract armor from damage, then lower armor die by one
    * Armor may not lower below a 1
* Fail: Full damage
* Fumble: Enemy does double damage

## Spell

Test Int (wizards) or Wis (clerics)

* Critical: Double effect and keep spell
* Complete: Effect and keep spell
* Partial: Effect and lose spell
* Miss: No effect and lose spell
* Fumble: Magical mishap

## After Combat

Any armor dice showing a 1 must make a usage test using the die. A failure degrades the armor one step. Note the damaged value of the armor in the equipment section.

# General Tests and Saves

For most tests and saves, just use success (8+) or failure. If a player has an appropriate background for the test, they get advantage.

# Exploration

Each day is divided into four hour watches, for a total of six watches each day (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night). For each watch, choose one: explore, move, or rest. The procedures are slightly different if characters are in a dungeon or wilderness.

## End of Watch

* Check for encounters
* Resource usage dice as appropriate
    * Torches, rope, spikes, etc
* Dusk only
    * Spend one food
* Dawn only
    * Spellcasters memorize spells if they rested for two watches

## Wilderness Exploration Procedure

* Explore
    * Find something in the hex, if it's there
* Move
    * Attempt to move to an adjacent hex
    * Check for getting lost
        * Scout makes a Wis check
        * If failed, lose a day, return to where you are
* Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die and regain that many hit points
    * Repair. Spend repair cost and test to repair armor or weapon (Con), on success, improve usage die up to max
    * Memorize. Test to memorize spell (Int) / beseech prayer (Wis), on success, gain one spell or prayer up to max
    * Forage. Test (Wis)
        * Complete: gain one food or random herb / plant of interest
        * Partial: food is rotten or comprimised in some way
        * Failure: encounter

## Dungeon Exploration Procedure

At the end of each watch in the dungeon, roll usage die for light.

* Explore
    * Slow, cautious, movement
    * May carefully search up to *four* medium sized rooms
        * Find something of interest in each room, if it exists
    * Gain advantage if traps are triggered
* Move
    * Move quickly without searching
        * Also for fleeing
    * May cover three times as much ground as exploration
    * Automatically surprised and disadvantage if traps are triggered
* Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die with disadvantage and regain that many hit points
    * Memorize. Test to learn spell or prayer (Int/Wis) with disadvantage, on success, gain one spell or prayer

# Enemies

Most B/X style enemy stat blocks are appropriate for this game. The big difference is AC. Instead use armor value from 0-6 as appropriate.

# Experience Points and Levels

* One XP for each silver piece worth of treasure recovered
* 1000 XP for each dangerous hex explored
* 2000 XP for each dangerous dungeon explored

## Level Up Procedure

* You may increase either (choose one) primary attribute by one.
* Roll a number of hit dice equal to new level and add them together.
    * Add Con to each roll.
    * If result is higher than maximum hit points, use new result as maximum.
* Note any new class abilities.
