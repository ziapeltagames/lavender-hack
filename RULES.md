# Strict Time Records

Welcome to _Strict Time Records_ (_STR_)! This is a role-playing game based on a variety of games from the [Old School Renaissance](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/1144/what-defines-the-old-school-renaissance). However, it incorporates some very new school ideas, such as success with cost and abstract but well integrated resource management.

Note: yes, this is one crazy big doc. I'm iterating enough that it makes it easier to make changes in this format. Eventually I'll divide it up into different docs for different topics. Or maybe not. It is github after all. I dunno.

### Blather

Hi! I'm Phil Lewis. I wrote some of this and stole the rest. I'm going to use these sections to rant and ramble and add more context. Skip them if you're just looking for rules.

The title is a Gygaxian reference to the first edition _Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide_ beseeching Dungeon Masters to use time pressure effectively. Way back in the mid 1980s, I found this idea fun in theory, but cumbersome in practice. One of the core goals of this system is to make that time pressure concept central to the game while keeping the fiddly bits manageable and meaningful. That's kind of my jam. I wrote another game called _Wrath of the Autarch_(https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/191025/Wrath-of-the-Autarch) which is fun if you want a really deep dive on domain management.

There is also a goal to hew somewhat close to a [B/X](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/110274/DD-Basic-Set-Rulebook-B-X-ed-Basic) core so I can use OSR content like [_Barrowmaze_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/139762/Barrowmaze-Complete) or [_Hot Springs Island_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/215340/The-Dark-of-Hot-Springs-Island) or [_Night's Dark Terror_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17119/B10-Nights-Dark-Terror-Basic) without too much pain.

This game itself probably doesn't fit into the OSR, but if you use B/X to cover up any holes (of which there are many), you'll probably be in pretty good shape. It also probably goes without saying, but you already need to understand RPGs and B/X to make sense of this. If you're completely new, get started with _5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons_ and come back after you've played a few games.

# Core Mechanics

The core mechanic for _Strict Time Records_ is a player facing d20 (twenty sided die) system. Most rolls use a modifier based on one of six standard attributes: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Wisdom (Wis), Intelligence (Int), Constitution (Con), and Charisma (Cha). You roll the d20, add an ability modifier (which could be negative), and compare the total against a fixed set of results. These attributes are on the 3-18 scale, and have the same bonuses and penalties as in B/X D&D.

* 18: +3
* 16-17: +2
* 13-15: +1
* 9-12: +0
* 6-8: -1
* 4-5: -2
* 3: -3

Rolling to accomplish something using one of these attributes is called a **test**. If the final tally (d20 roll plus attribute modifier) is an 8 or higher, the test **succeeds**. Otherwise, it fails. Tests are specified like **roll Str** or **roll Cha**. Frequently **procedures** or **moves** need finer granularity beyond success and failure. In that case, the following degrees of success might be used.

* Natural 20: **Critical** Success
* 18+: **Complete** Success
* 8+: **Partial** Success / Success with Cost
* 7-: **Miss**
* Natural 1: **Fumble**

The **natural** above refers to a d20 test that shows the number in question, regardless of modifiers. For example, if you're making a Strength test with a +2 modifier to the roll, and the roll shows an 18, that is not a critical even though the total is a 20.

### Blather

I really wanted to keep the widely known d20 interpretations of 1 as a fumble or massive failure and 20 as a critical success.

## Advantage/Disadvantage

Some situations can result in a test roll having **advantage** or **disadvantage**. If a player has advantage on a test, they roll two dice and take the result they wish. If they have disadvantage, they roll two dice and the GM takes the result they wish. This frequently applies to tests (d20 rolls), but could apply to any other dice rolls (of any dice type) as specified. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.

## Bonuses/Penalties

There are certain situations where bonuses and penalties are applied to a test roll. These are just additional modifiers added to the result. The main source of bonuses and penlties are attributes.

# Procedures and Moves

This game uses a variety of procedures, which are sets of steps used to handle situations that occur in the game. They tend to be more tactical and turn based in nature, feeling a little more like a boardgame. Combat is one example of a procedure, as is overland travel.

Moves are sets of actions to take in certain narrative situations. The name of a move is typically in bold, and there is commonly a test involved, along with five different results depending on the degree of success. Moves might be part of a procedure, or they can stand alone, triggered when the fiction in the game matches the description of the move.

Essentially, procedures tie together sequences of moves, typically in a turn based format, and make it part of a mini-game. Such as using a **melee attack** move in combat. However, moves can stand alone, and be referenced when the fiction calls for it, such as **carousing in town** when you spend funds to party it up.

### Blather

Moves come from [_Apocalypse World_](http://apocalypse-world.com/), which burst forth on the RPG scene in 2010 and certainly had a major impact on game design. There are quite a few PbtA (Powered by the Apocalypse) games which leverage, to varying degrees of success, the tech from _Apocalypse World_.

For myself, I like the idea of moves as these mechanical widgets which can push the fiction in all sorts of interesting directions. However, when games are built of nothing but those, I tend to get bored quickly. I like structured mini-games as well, such as Duel of Wits in [_Burning Wheel_](https://www.burningwheel.com/) or combat in [_The One Ring_](http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/the-one-ring/). The purists might blanch at this approach, but I see no incompatibility from mixing the "talk in the funny voices" parts of rpgs with the "win at a game" parts of rpgs.

# Usage Dice

Usage dice are used as a general purpose tracking mechanism. Mostly they're used for **resources** and **food** and other gear which can break or get used up over time. But they also track things like **fatigue** and party **discord**. The dice form a ladder of sorts, going from highest to lowest as **d12 <--> d10 <--> d8 <--> d6 <--> d4 <--> Broken / Used / Gone**.

If the rules instruct you to **raise** a usage die, you increase the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped out with a d10. If the rules instruct you to **lower** a usage die, you lower the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped with a d6. There are a variety of ways and reasons usage dice are raised and lowered.

## Rolling Usage Dice

Usage dice might be rolled for a variety of reasons. If the result of rolling a usage die is a 1-3, the die is lowered one step. The more they're used, the more they're used up!

### Blather

Usage dice come from the game [_Black Hack_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition), although they are also used very effectively and extensively in [_Macchiato Monsters_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264169/Macchiato-Monsters). Note that in _Black Hack_ they lower on a 1-2. I used the _MM_ version, which is where the 1-3 comes from.

I love the concept, although getting them to function well as an economy is one of the most active parts of development. Who knows, maybe they won't be as good of a fit as simple counters. It certainly requires a decent amount of rolling to make them viable.

## Value

The game uses an abstract concept of **value**. Items and gear are sorted into six broad categories, each of exponential worth. Occasionally it is necessary to compare a usage die to this value, as given in the table below. _STR_ uses a copper penny standard for currency, when there is currency, which isn't often. Instead, value tends to be very relative to groups and cultures.

| Usage Die | Value | Class | Copper Pennies | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | 1 | Beggar | 10 | Sack of Potatoes |
| d4 | 2 | Peasant | 100 | Dagger |
| d6 | 3 | Squire | 1,000 | Broadsword |
| d8 | 4 | Knight | 10,000 | Platemail Armor |
| d10 | 5 | Noble | 100,0000 | Manor House |
| d12 | 6 | Royal | 1,000,000 | Keep |

# Party Sheet

There is a party sheet for all the players which tracks four important party level concepts, each tracked with a different usage die. They are **resources**, **discord**, **food**, and **light**.

## Resources Die

The resources usage die tracks just that, resources the party has available. These are things like blankets, backpacks, oil flasks, lockpicks, writing ink, spellbooks, and large burlap sacks. In short, most everything the well equipped adventurer needs. The higher the die type, the better the quality and quantity of resources. Different class abilities can use the resources die.

### Blather

There tends to be lots of assorted gear that players track on their character sheets. Most of it is very similar and creates overhead without much interest. The resource die abstracts all of that out. In essence, the only items tracked by players tend to be weapons, swords, treasure, and very unique items.

The resource die also provides an interesting mechanism for different classes to exploit narratively.

# Level Up Procedure

* Roll d20 with advantage and compare to favored attribute. If higher, increase attribute by one.
* Choose any attribute, roll d20 and compare. If higher, increase attribute by one.
* Roll a number of hit dice equal to new level. If higher than current hit points, use new amount.
* Note any new class abilities.

# Equipment

Use _Knave_ prices for now - copper piece standard!

* d6 Short sword, staff, club, short bow
* d8 Sword, mace, spear, polearm, axe, longbow, crossbow, pistol
* d10 Greatsword, battle axe, lance, flail, musket, heavy crossbow

For various reasons, weapons can become less effective. In this case, lower the damage die as if it was a usage die (d8 to d6, d6 to d4, etc).

## Armor Usage

Armor usage dice are used during combat, informing the players of how effective their armor is.

* dU4 Leather
* dU6 Studded leather, ring, scale
* dU8 Chain, half-plate
* dU10 Full plate with helmet

Note: A shield steps up the usage die once.

## Resources

* dU6 Torches, spikes
* dU8 Arrows, oil, mule, rope

# Encounter

* Check for range
* Check for surprise
    * Dex checks, if passed, no surprise
* Choose approach
    * Communicate
    * Combat
        * Roll usage dice for armor at start of combat
    * Flee
        * Enemy may make free strikes as appropriate
        * A chase ensues

# Communicate

One player may make a Cha test. If there isn't a mutually understandable language, roll with disadvantage. If the characters trade something of value to the other group or have leverage for some reason, roll with advantage.

* Critical: Friendly
* Complete: Talkative
* Partial: Unsure
* Miss: Unfriendly
* Fumble: Hostile

# Combat

Combat is divided up into rounds, which use the following procedure.

* Declare Actions
    * Melee / Missile / Spell
* Check Initiative (Dex Test)
    * If passed, character is quick, otherwise they are slow
* Quick Actions
* Enemy Actions
    * Slow characters using missile or spells may be interrupted if damaged
    * Players roll to defend, although the GM rolls for monster damage or effects
* Slow Actions
* Morale Check
    * Single Enemy: First hit, 1/2 hp lost, 3/4 hp lost
    * Group: First casualty, 1/2 dead, 3/4 dead

Actions are chosen from the list below. In general, movement is possible in addition to an action. This list of actions is not exhaustive - using items (potions, rings, scrolls, wands) and other special abilities (turning) may qualify. If possible, actions should be made to fit the critical / complete / partial / fumble framework.

## Armor

Armor dice are rolled as needed (don't roll all the armor dice at the start of combat). Once rolled, the value is set for the duration of the combat. Enemies do not roll for armor - they have fixed value listed in the stat block.

## Melee

Test Strength.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Complete: Bypass armor
* Partial: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Exertion (lower armor die value, to a minimum of one)
   * Exposed position
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Missile

Test Dexterity.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Complete: Bypass armor
* Partial: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Ammo check (ammunition usage)
   * Exposed position
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Defend

Used whenever an enemy makes a physically damaging attack. This is a player facing game, so the player rolls. Test Constitution.

* Critical: No damage and enemy is in an exposed position
* Complete: No damage
* Partial: Subtract armor from damage, but lower armor value by one
    * For example, if a player rolls a 5 for chain mail at the start of combat, it is now a 4
    * Armor may not lower below a 1
* Fail: Full damage
* Fumble: Enemy does double damage

## Spell

Test Int (wizards) or Wis (clerics)

* Critical: Double effect and keep spell
* Complete: Effect and keep spell
* Partial: Effect and lose spell
* Fumble: Lose spell

## After Combat

Any armor dice showing a 1 must make a usage test. A failure degrades the armor one step.

# General Tests and Saves

For most tests and saves, just use success (8+) or failure. If a player has an appropriate background for the test, they get advantage.

# Adventure

Each day is divided into four hour watches, for a total of six watches each day (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night). For each watch, choose one: explore, move, or rest. The procedures are slightly different if characters are in a dungeon or wilderness.

## End of Watch

* Check for encounters
* Resource usage dice as appropriate
    * Torches, rope, spikes, etc
* Dusk only
    * Spend one food
* Dawn only
    * Spellcasters memorize spells if they rested for two watches

## Wilderness

* Explore
    * Find something in the hex, if it's there
* Move
    * Attempt to move to an adjacent hex
    * Check for getting lost
        * Scout makes a Wis check
        * If failed, lose a day, return to where you are
* Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die and regain that many hit points
    * Repair. Spend repair cost and test to repair armor or weapon (Con), on success, improve usage die up to max
    * Memorize. Test to memorize spell (Int) / beseech prayer (Wis), on success, gain one spell or prayer up to max
    * Forage. Test (Wis)
        * Complete: gain one food or random herb / plant of interest
        * Partial: food is rotten or comprimised in some way
        * Failure: encounter

## Dungeon

At the end of each watch in the dungeon, test any usage die for light sources or other equipment used.

* Explore
    * Slow, cautious, movement
    * May carefully search up to *four* medium sized rooms
        * Find something of interest in each room, if it exists
    * Gain advantage if traps are triggered
* Move
    * Move quickly without searching
        * Also for fleeing
    * May cover three times as much ground as exploration
    * Automatically surprised and disadvantage if traps are triggered
* Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die with disadvantage and regain that many hit points
    * Memorize. Test to learn spell or prayer (Int/Wis) with disadvantage, on success, gain one spell or prayer

# Enemies

Most B/X style enemy stat blocks are appropriate for this game. The big difference is AC. Instead use armor value from 0-6 as appropriate. If not sure, an armor of 1 or 2 is best.

# Experience Points

* One XP for each silver piece worth of treasure recovered
* 1000 XP for each dangerous hex explored
* 2000 XP for each dangerous dungeon explored
