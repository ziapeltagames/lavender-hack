# Lavender Hack

This document will eventually be broken out into multiple sections. For now, though, it is consolidated here. This is mostly based on _B/X Essentials_, so use that to fill in gaps. The big difference is that rolling an 8+ on a d20 is a general metric for success, rather than having a variety of resolution mechanics. There are also more granular procedures for many situations.

# The Core Mechanic

The core mechanic for Lavender Hack is a player facing d20 system. Most rolls use one of six standard attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma. You roll the d20, add an ability modifier, and compare against a fixed set of results. These attributes are on the 3-18 scale, and have the same bonuses as in B/X D&D.

* 18: +3
* 16-17: +2
* 13-15: +1
* 9-12: +0
* 6-8: -1
* 4-5: -2
* 3: -3

Rolling to accomplish something using one of these attributes is called a *test*. If the final tally (d20 roll plus attribute modifier) is an 8 or higher, the test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. Frequently procedures need finer granularity beyond success and failure. In that case, the following degrees of success may be used.

* Natural 20: Critical Success
* 18+: Complete Success
* 8+: Partial Success / Success with Cost
* 7-: Miss
* Natural 1: Fumble

The “natural” language above references a d20 test roll that shows the number in question, regardless of modifiers.

## Advantage/Disadvantage

Some situations can result in a test roll having *advantage* or *disadvantage*. If a player has advantage on a test, they roll two d20s and take the higher result. If they have disadvantage, they roll two d20s and take the lower result.

## Bonuses/Penalties

There are certain situations where bonuses and penalties are applied to test roll. These are just additional modifiers added to the result. The main source of bonuses and penlties are attributes.

# Character Creation

* Roll 3d6 in order for Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma.

# Watch Procedure

Each day is divided into four hour watches, for a total of six watches each day (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night). For each watch, choose one: explore, move, or rest. The procedures are slightly different if characters are in a dungeon or wilderness.

At the end of each day, spend one food.

    * Roll one hit die and regain that many hit points.
