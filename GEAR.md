## The Gear Die

As mentioned earlier, most common adventuring gear is abstracted out into the gear die. It is assumed characters have standard sorts of gear, such as appropriate clothing, tents, bedrolls, flint and steel, sacks, backpacks, rope, parchment, iron spikes, and class related items like repair kits, lockpicks, spellbooks, and spell reagents.

If the players want gear that is more odd, like a shrimp net or an hourglass, they may produce it, but must roll the gear die. Very specific things which may pertain to mission goals, like a unicorn horn, or magic items, like a balm of healing, can't be produced with the gear die. Also, gear produced this way can't be transferred to a character sheet. You can't use the gear die as an item generator for trade!

## Food and Light

Food and light are tracked separately from other adventuring gear. The food and light usage dice both refresh to a d8 at the start of an adventure. They are detailed further in the exploration section.

## Valuables

The only things written into slots on character sheets are armor, weapons, and valuables. Valuables are specific items which have a value. Typically these are treasures and magic items found in dungeons, herbs found on mountainsides, or pieces of legendary creatures like a manticore stinger. However, they could also be things like a deck of cards or tattoo making gear.

Usually valuables are traded for other things. However, they can be used to give advantage on any test. If the result is a complete success, though, it is assumed the item is used up in the process and is removed from the character sheet.

## Currency

TBD (100 is one slot)

## Weapons

| Name | Damage | Value | Slots | Effects | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dagger | d4 | 2 | 1  |
| Shortsword | d6 | 2 | 1  |
| Longsword | d8 | 3 |  2 |
| Mace | d8 | 2 |  1 |
| Greatsword | d10 | 3 | 2 | Two Handed, Slow |  |
| Shortbow | d6 | 2 | 1 | Two Handed | Short |
| Longbow | d8 | 2 | 2 | Two Handed | Long |
| Crossbow | d10 | 2 | 2 | Two Handed, Slow | Long |
| Pistol | d10 | 3 | 1 | Gunpowder | Short |

Characters using slow weapons will always take slow actions during the combat procedure (don't roll initiative).

For various reasons, weapons can become less effective. If this happens, lower the damage die as if it was a usage die (d8 to d6, d6 to d4, etc). Record the new damage dice amount on the character sheet next to the original damage.

## Armor

Armor dice are used during combat, informing the players of how effective their armor is.

| Name | Protection | Value | Slots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Leather | d4 | 1 | 1 |
| Chain | d6 | 2 | 2 |
| Half Plate | d8 | 3 | 3 |
| Full Plate | d10 | 4 | 3 |
| Shield | +1 Step | 2 | 1 |

Note: A shield steps up the armor die once, in a similar fashion to a usage die. For example, leather and a shield is a d6 armor die. Armor, like weapons, can also become damaged.
