# Valuables

_Lavender Hack_ uses an abstract concept of **value**. Items and gear are sorted into ten broad value categories, each of exponential worth. _LHC_ uses a copper penny standard for currency, when there is currency, which isn't often. Instead, value tends to be very relative to each culture. A big part of _LHC_ is discovering and trading with different groups. The value in terms of copper pennies is only provided as a rough guideline. Occasionally it is necessary to compare a usage die to this scale, which is also given in the table below.

| Value | Usage Die | Copper Pennies | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | d20 | 1 | Moldy Potato |
| 2 | d4 | 5 | Bushel of Grain |
| 3 | d6 | 25 | Small Bell |
| 4 | d8 | 125 | Shield |
| 5 | d10 | 625 | Longsword |
| 6 | d12 | 3,000 | Half Plate |
| 7 | - | 15,000 | Full Plate |
| 8 | - | 80,000 | Stone Tower |
| 9 | - | 400,000 | Warship |
| 10 | - | 2,000,000 | Stronghold |

Items such as weapons, armor, and valuables are described by a **type**, a **value**, and the number of **slots** required to carry it. Weapons and armor are further described by how much damage they do or how much protection they afford. The type is a general class, such as clothing, art, armor, jewelry, potion, animal, or plant.

## Slots

Characters start the game with a number of slots equal to 5 + Str modifier. Most all items take one slot each. This isn't many slots, but it's assumed the character is carrying lots of other things not on their character sheet. Those things are represented by the gear, food, and light dice.

## Combining Valuables

It is possible to combine **five** things of one value into something of the next highest value. It is also possible to trade something down into five things of the lower value. However! When trading down, each thing traded for takes one slot. It takes lots of space to have flexibility. In general, the game focuses on trading specific sorts of valuables for other types of valuables. In the wilds, factions don't care about standard currency exchange rates. Things are always worth what someone is willing to give you.

## Coins and Slots

It takes roughly 100 coins to occupy one slot. This also holds true for other lighter things like a piece of paper. This rule mainly comes into play when extracting treasure from underground. In this case, it's fine to merge treasure into one slot of a particular value, such as "sack of six gems, value 4".

Where possible, error on giving items one slot each. This is a useful and necessary abstraction, partly justified by all the other gear characters are burdened with. Yes, of course, a deck of cards doesn't weigh the same as a shield, but slots are not just raw encumbrance, but also _personal value_ and importance for a character. If the things on a character sheet are lighter, it means that character is most likely carrying more of the other sorts of gear. After all, the character in full plate probably also isn't hauling 30 lbs of food.
