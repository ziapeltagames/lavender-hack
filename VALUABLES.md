# Gear, Valuables, and Currency

_LHC_ uses an abstract concept of **value**. Items and gear are sorted into six broad values, each of exponential worth. _LHC_ uses a copper penny standard for currency, when there is currency, which isn't often. Instead, value tends to be very relative to different groups and cultures. A big part of _LHC_ is discovering and trading with different groups. The value in terms of copper pennies is only provided as a rough guideline.

Occasionally it is necessary to compare a usage die to this scale, as given in the table below. 

 | Value | Class | Copper Pennies | Example | Usage Die |
 | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | 1 | Beggar | 10 | Sack of Potatoes | None |
 | 2 | Peasant | 100 | Dagger | d4 |
 | 3 | Squire | 1,000 | Broadsword | d6 |
 | 4 | Knight | 10,000 | Platemail Armor | d8 |
 | 5 | Noble | 100,0000 | Manor House | d10 |
 | 6 | Royal | 1,000,000 | Keep | d12 |

 Items such as weapons, armor, and valuables are described by a **type**, a **value**, and the number of **slots** required to carry it. Weapons and armor are further described by how much damage they do or how much protection they afford. The type is a general class, such as clothing, art, armor, jewelry, potion, animal, or plant.

## Slots

Characters start the game with a number of slots equal to 5 + Str modifier. Most all items take one slot each. This isn't many slots, but it's assumed the character is carrying lots of other things not on their character sheet.

## The Gear Die

As mentioned earlier, most common adventuring gear is abstracted out into the gear die. It is assumed characters have standard sorts of gear, such as appropriate clothing, tents, bedrolls, flint and steel, sacks, backpacks, rope, parchment, iron spikes, and class related items like repair kits, lockpicks, spellbooks, and spell reagents.

If the players want gear that is more odd, like a shrimp net or an hourglass, they may produce it, but must roll the gear die. Very specific things which may pertain to mission goals, like a unicorn horn, or magic items, like a balm of healing, can't be produced with the gear die. Also, gear produced this way can't be transferred to a character sheet. You can't use the gear die as an item generator for trade!

## Food and Light

Food and light are tracked separately from other adventuring gear. The food and light usage dice both refresh to a d8 at the start of an adventure. They are detailed further in the exploration section.

## Valuables

The only things written into slots on character sheets are armor, weapons, and valuables. Valuables are specific items which have a value. Typically these are treasures and magic items found in dungeons, herbs found on mountainsides, or pieces of legendary creatures like a manticore stinger. However, they could also be things like a deck of cards or tattoo making gear.

Usually valuables are traded for other things. However, they can be used to give advantage on any test. If the result is a complete success, though, it is assumed the item is used up in the process and is removed from the character sheet.

## Currency

TBD (100 is one slot)

## Weapons

| Name | Damage | Value | Slots | Effects | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dagger | d4 | 2 | 1  |
| Shortsword | d6 | 2 | 1  |
| Longsword | d8 | 3 |  2 |
| Mace | d8 | 2 |  1 |
| Greatsword | d10 | 3 | 2 | Two Handed, Slow |  |
| Shortbow | d6 | 2 | 1 | Two Handed | Short |
| Longbow | d8 | 2 | 2 | Two Handed | Long |
| Crossbow | d10 | 2 | 2 | Two Handed, Slow | Long |
| Pistol | d10 | 3 | 1 | Gunpowder | Short |

Characters using slow weapons will always take slow actions during the combat procedure (don't roll initiative).

For various reasons, weapons can become less effective. If this happens, lower the damage die as if it was a usage die (d8 to d6, d6 to d4, etc). Record the new damage dice amount on the character sheet next to the original damage.

## Armor

Armor dice are used during combat, informing the players of how effective their armor is.

| Name | Protection | Value | Slots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Leather | d4 | 1 | 1 |
| Chain | d6 | 2 | 2 |
| Half Plate | d8 | 3 | 3 |
| Full Plate | d10 | 4 | 3 |
| Shield | +1 Step | 2 | 1 |

Note: A shield steps up the armor die once, in a similar fashion to a usage die. For example, leather and a shield is a d6 armor die. Armor, like weapons, can also become damaged.
