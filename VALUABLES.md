# Valuables

_Lavender Hack_ uses an abstract concept of **value**. Items and gear are sorted into six broad values, each of exponential worth. _LHC_ uses a copper penny standard for currency, when there is currency, which isn't often. Instead, value tends to be very relative to different groups and cultures. A big part of _LHC_ is discovering and trading with different groups. The value in terms of copper pennies is only provided as a rough guideline.

Occasionally it is necessary to compare a usage die to this scale, as given in the table below. A d20 and a d4 are less than 1.

| Value | Class | Copper Pennies | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Beggar | 10 | Sack of Potatoes |
| 2 | Peasant | 100 | Dagger |
| 3 | Squire | 1,000 | Broadsword |
| 4 | Knight | 10,000 | Platemail Armor |
| 5 | Noble | 100,0000 | Manor House |
| 6 | Royal | 1,000,000 | Keep |

Items such as weapons, armor, and valuables are described by a **type**, a **value**, and the number of **slots** required to carry it. Weapons and armor are further described by how much damage they do or how much protection they afford. The type is a general class, such as clothing, art, armor, jewelry, potion, animal, or plant.

## Slots

Characters start the game with a number of slots equal to 5 + Str modifier. Most all items take one slot each. This isn't many slots, but it's assumed the character is carrying lots of other things not on their character sheet.
