# Core Mechanics

The core mechanic for _Lavender Hack_ is a player facing d20 (twenty sided die) system. Most rolls use a modifier based on one of six standard attributes: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Wisdom (Wis), Intelligence (Int), Constitution (Con), and Charisma (Cha). You roll the d20, add the related attribute modifier (which could be negative), and compare the total against a fixed set of results. These attributes start on the 3-18 scale, and have the same bonuses and penalties as in B/X D&D.

## Attribute Range

* 20: +5
* 19: +4
* 18: +3
* 16-17: +2
* 13-15: +1
* 9-12: +0
* 6-8: -1
* 4-5: -2
* 3: -3

Note that if the game says something like **add Con** or **plus Str**, that always means the attribute modifier, never the original attribute.

## Tests

Rolling to accomplish something using one of these attributes is called a **test**. A d20 is rolled and usually an attribute modifier is added. If the final tally (d20 roll plus attribute modifier) is an **8 or higher**, the test **succeeds**. Tests are specified like **roll Str** or **roll Cha**. Frequently, finer granularity is needed beyond just determining success. In that case, the following degrees of success are used.

* Natural 20: **Critical** Success
* 18+: **Complete** Success
* 8+: **Partial** Success / Success with Cost
* 7-: **Miss** / Complication
* Natural 1: **Fumble**

The **natural** above refers to a d20 test roll that shows the number in question, regardless of modifiers. For example, if you're making a Strength test with a +2 modifier to the roll, and the roll shows an 18, that is not a critical even though the total is a 20.

### Blather

I really wanted to keep the widely known d20 interpretations of 1 as a fumble or massive failure and 20 as a critical success. It's easier to ~~trick~~ persuade people into playing.

## Advantage/Disadvantage

Some situations can result in a test roll having **advantage** or **disadvantage**. If a player has advantage on a test, they roll two dice and take the result they wish. If they have disadvantage, they roll two dice and the GM takes the result they wish. This frequently applies to tests (d20 rolls), but could apply to any other dice rolls (of any dice type) as specified. Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.

## Bonuses/Penalties

There are certain situations where bonuses and penalties are applied to a test roll. These are just additional modifiers added to the result. The main source of bonuses and penalties are attributes.

# Procedures and Moves

_LHC_ uses a variety of **procedures**, which are sets of steps used to handle situations that occur in the game. Procedures tend to be more tactical and turn based in nature. Combat is one example of a procedure, as is overland exploration.

**Moves** are narrative and mechanical results that occur when triggered by specific fictional situations. The name of a move is typically in bold, and there is commonly a test involved, along with different results that reflect the nature of the move. Moves might be part of a procedure, or they can stand alone, triggered when the fiction in the game matches the description of the move.

Essentially, procedures tie together sequences of moves, typically in a turn based format, and make it part of a mini-game. Such as using a **melee attack** move in combat. However, moves can stand alone, and be referenced when the fiction calls for it, such as **carousing in town** when you spend funds to party it up. When moves stand alone, there is more latitude in interpreting the results. A 7- isn't so much about failing to do a thing as it is the level of complication and fallout that occurs.

### Blather

Moves come from [_Apocalypse World_](http://apocalypse-world.com/), which burst forth on the RPG scene in 2010 and certainly had a major impact on game design. There are quite a few PbtA (Powered by the Apocalypse) games which leverage, to varying degrees of success, the tech from _Apocalypse World_.

For myself, I like the idea of moves as these mechanical widgets which can push the fiction in all sorts of interesting directions. However, when games are built of nothing but those, I tend to get bored. I like structured mini-games as well, such as Duel of Wits in [_Burning Wheel_](https://www.burningwheel.com/) or combat in [_The One Ring_](http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/the-one-ring/). The purists might blanch at this approach, but I see no incompatibility from mixing the "talk in the funny voices" parts of rpgs with the "win at a game" parts of rpgs.

# Usage Dice

Usage dice are a general purpose tracking mechanism. They're used for **resources**, **food**, and **light**, as well as to track more abstract concepts like **fatigue** and party **discord**. The dice form a ladder of sorts, going from highest to lowest: **d12 <--> d10 <--> d8 <--> d6 <--> d4 <--> Broken / Used / Gone**.

If the rules instruct you to **raise** a usage die, you increase the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped out with a d10. If the rules instruct you to **lower** a usage die, you lower the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped with a d6. There are a variety of ways and reasons usage dice are raised and lowered. A d12 can't be raised and a d4 which is lowered is removed, that thing now being used up, broken, or gone.

## Rolling Usage Dice

Usage dice might be rolled for a variety of reasons. If the result of rolling a usage die is a **1-3**, the die is lowered one step. The more they're used, the more they're used up!

### Blather

Usage dice come from the game [_Black Hack_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition), although they are also used very effectively and extensively in [_Macchiato Monsters_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264169/Macchiato-Monsters). Note that in _Black Hack_ they lower on a 1-2. I used the _MM_ version, which is where the 1-3 comes from.

I love the concept, although getting them to function well as an economy is one of the most active parts of development. Who knows, maybe they won't be as good of a fit as simple counters. It certainly requires a decent amount of rolling to make them viable.

# Party Sheet

There is a party sheet for all the players which tracks four important party level concepts, each tracked with a different usage die. They are **resources**, **discord**, **food**, and **light**.

## Resource

The resource usage die tracks just that, resources the party has available. These are things like blankets, backpacks, oil flasks, lockpicks, writing ink, spellbooks, and large burlap sacks. In short, most everything the well equipped adventurer needs. The higher the die type, the better the quality and quantity of resources. Different class abilities can use the resources die.

### Blather

There tends to be lots of assorted gear that players track on their character sheets. Most of it is very similar and creates overhead without much interest. The resource die abstracts all of that out. In essence, the only items tracked by players tend to be weapons, swords, treasure, and very unique items. This fits in well with an abstract weight system, since there isn't as much to track, the assumption being you're already weighed down by stuff not on your character sheet.

The resource die also provides an interesting mechanism for different classes to exploit narratively. For example, thieves might be able to use it to make a trap, warriors can use it to fix broken armor, and spellcasters can use it for better spell components.

## Food and Light

Food and light are tracked indepently from resources, since they function more as timers during travel. The exploration section details these more.

## Discord

Discord represents party cohesion. If the group is happy, well rested, and ready to go, the discord die is not present. It is raised during stressful situations and can impact various moves negatively, particularly trade and other social situations. It is special in that when it is rolled, it is **not lowered on a 1-3** unless specifically indicated.

# General Tests and Saves

For most tests and saves, just use success (8+) or failure. If a player has an appropriate background for the test, they get advantage.
