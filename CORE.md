# Core Rules

Because one of the goals of _Lavender Hack_ is to work with B/X content, much of this will look familiar to anyone who has played that style of game. There are ability scores, a twenty sided dice, classes, hit points, gear, combat, and exploration. There are some different bits as well, which will become apparent shortly.

# Ability Scores

Ability scores are a very core part of the game, and the first thing you calculate when making a character. There are six, and they should come as no surprise: **Strength (Str)**, **Dexterity (Dex)**, **Wisdom (Wis)**, **Intelligence (Int)**, **Constitution (Con)**, and **Charisma (Cha)**. Since you've already played this sort of game, I'm not going to spend words explaining how to interpret them.

These ability scores start on the 3-18 scale, but it is possible for them to be raised higher than that later on. Along with the value of the ability score, there is also a modifier, which can range from -3 to +5. The modifiers are calculated as follows.

## Ability Score Modifiers

* 20: +5
* 19: +4
* 18: +3
* 16-17: +2
* 13-15: +1
* 9-12: +0
* 6-8: -1
* 4-5: -2
* 3: -3

The modifiers are far more important to the game than the actual score. In fact, the score is really only used to calculate the modifier, but the modifiers are used very frequently. If the game text says something like **add Con** or **+ Str**, that means the ability score modifier, never the original ability score. The modifier added may be negative, thus lowering the result! The ability scores can change over the course of the game (particularly as your character grows in power), which may also change the associated modifier.

# Tests

The game involves an interaction between a gamemaster and the players. The gamemaster gets the ball rolling by setting scenes and situations that the players find themselves in. At certain points, a player will want to accomplish something which is both uncertain and interesting. The players may decide a die roll is called for to figure out what happens. How _difficult_ a thing is to do is less important than whether both success and failure are _interesting_.

The player gives a vague outline of what their character is intending to do. It is important not to fill in too many details, because the die roll will determine what happens! The players then determine which ability score is most applicable to this action. After that a d20 (twenty sided die) is rolled and the related ability score modifier is added to the result.

If the final tally (d20 roll plus attribute modifier) is an **8 or higher**, the test **succeeds**. If it's below that number, the action fails and there is some sort of consequence. Frequently, finer granularity is needed beyond just determining whether an action succeeds. In that case, the following degrees of success are used.

* Natural 20: **Critical** Success
* 18+: **Strong** Success
* 8+: **Weak** Success
* 7-: **Miss**
* Natural 1: **Fumble**

The **natural** above refers to a d20 test roll that shows the number in question, regardless of modifiers. For example, if you're making a Strength test with a +2 modifier to the roll, and the roll shows an 18, that is not a critical even though the total is a 20. A weak success may incur some sort of cost as part of success, or is perhaps a lesser degree of success.

### Blather

I really wanted to keep the widely known d20 interpretations of 1 as a fumble or massive failure and 20 as a critical success. The roll under ability score OSR variants are cleanly designed, but there's a ton of cultural inertia around what rolling a 20 means.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Some situations can result in a test roll having **advantage** or **disadvantage**. If a player has advantage on a test, they roll two dice and take the result they wish. If they have disadvantage, they roll two dice and the GM takes the result they wish. This frequently applies to tests (d20 rolls), but could apply to any other dice rolls (of any dice type) as specified. If a player has both advantage and disadvantage on a roll, they cancel each other out.

## Keep Criticals and Fumbles

Other situations may allow a player to add to the result in various ways, or re-roll the result. This may allow them to change a miss into a weak success or a weak success into a strong success. However, **fumbles and criticals can't be altered after the roll**. That's the result.

## Specific Tests

Some tests have specific fictional situations and results under which they can occur. If there is an applicable specific test, use that instead of the general test framework. For example, the following test is used when a character is fighting with a hand weapon in combat. Don't worry about what the results mean for now. The important thing to understand is that in some cases the results are already filled in.

_When you're nearby an enemy in combat with a melee weapon in hand, Test Str to make a **melee attack**._

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Strong: Bypass armor
* Weak: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Exertion (lower armor die value, to a minimum of one)
   * Exposed position (next defense roll is at disadvantage)
* Miss: Miss the target
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Saves

Saves are test which are more reactive. They work the same way, but they tend to be driven be the gamemaster or as a result of some other action. For instance, if a poisonous beast bites a character, they may have to make a save using their Constitution. As usual, an 8+ is successful. Weak and strong results may be used to further distinguish results as normal for tests.

# Procedures

**Procedures** are sequences of steps used to handle situations that occur in the game, such as exploration or combat. Procedures tend to be tactical and turn based in nature. There are usually various choices players may make at each step of the procedure, and procedures frequently use specific tests to resolve what happens.

Essentially, procedures tie together sequences of tests, typically in a turn based format, and make it part of a mini-game. Such as using a **melee attack** in combat. Procedures additionally have other sorts of choices and steps to take to figure out what happens.

### Blather

Specific tests track fairly close to moves come from [_Apocalypse World_](http://apocalypse-world.com/).  _Apocalypse World_ burst forth on the RPG scene in 2010 and certainly had a major impact on game design. There are quite a few PbtA (Powered by the Apocalypse) games which leverage, to varying degrees of success, the tech from _Apocalypse World_.

For myself, I like the idea of more free flowing mechanical widgets which can be triggered to push the fiction in all sorts of interesting directions. However, I really like structured mini-games as well, such as Duel of Wits in [_Burning Wheel_](https://www.burningwheel.com/) or combat in [_The One Ring_](http://cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/the-one-ring/). Turns have the advantage in that the spotlight tends to get shared more, and mini-games add tactical diversity and strategy to the system.

The purists might blanch at this approach, but I see no incompatibility from switching between the "talk in the funny voices" parts of rpgs and the "win at a game" parts of rpgs.

# Usage Dice

**Usage dice** are a general purpose tracking mechanism. In different situations, a usage die might be swapped out with a die of a different size. This forms a ladder of sorts, going from d12 at the highest to a d2 at the lowest: **d12 <--> d10 <--> d8 <--> d6 <--> d4 <--> d2(0)**. A d20 is used for the lowest step, where 1-10 means 1 and 11-20 means 2. A usage die can never be above a d12 or below a d20.

If used for an amount, the d12 represents having a lot of something and the d20 represents just scraping by. For example, a d12 food die means the characters have plenty of food of all different kinds, and a d20 means they have a few questionable berries found while foraging. If used for quality, a d12 represents something of the highest quality, while a d20 represents something makeshift. For example, if used for light, a d12 is a number of lanterns with plenty of oil, while a d2 is a makeshift candle using a torn bit of clothing.

If the rules instruct you to **step up** a usage die, you increase the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped out with a d10. If the rules instruct you to **step down** a usage die, you lower the die by one step. For example, a d8 would get swapped with a d6. There are a variety of ways and reasons usage dice are stepped up and down. A d12 can't be stepped up and a d20 can't be stepped down.

## Rolling Usage Dice

Usage dice might be rolled for a variety of reasons. If the result of rolling a usage die is a **1-3**, the die is **stepped down**. The more they're used, the more they're used up! Typically, rolling a 1 on a d20 triggers some sort of additional negative effect.

### Blather

Usage dice come from the game [_Black Hack_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition), although they are also used very effectively and extensively in [_Macchiato Monsters_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264169/Macchiato-Monsters). In _Black Hack_ they lower on a 1-2. I used the _MM_ version, which is where the 1-3 comes from.

I love the concept, although getting them to function well as an economy is one of the most active parts of development. Who knows, maybe they won't be as good of a fit as simple counters. In order for them to be viable, they need to be rolled fairly frequently.

# Resources

There is a party sheet for all the players which tracks four important party level resources, each tracked with a different usage die. They are **gear**, **fellowship**, **food**, and **light**.

## Gear

The gear usage die tracks just that, adventuring gear the party has available. These are things like blankets, backpacks, oil flasks, lockpicks, writing ink, spellbooks, and large burlap sacks. In short, most everything the well equipped adventurer needs. The higher the die type, the better the quality and quantity of gear. Different character class abilities can use the gear die to varying effect.

The most common way to use the gear die is to aid in a test. Each class may aid in tests for the **primary ability scores** of that class.

### Blather

There tends to be lots of assorted gear that players track on their character sheets. Most of it is very similar and creates overhead without much interest. The gear die abstracts all of that out. In essence, the only items tracked by players will be weapons, swords, treasure, and very unique items. This fits in well with the abstract slots based weight system, since there isn't as much to track, the assumption being you're already weighed down by stuff not on your character sheet.

The gear die also provides an interesting mechanism for different classes to exploit narratively. For example, thieves might be able to use it to make a trap, warriors can use it to fix broken armor, and spellcasters can use it for better spell components.

## Food and Light

Food and light are tracked indepently from gear, since they function more as timers during travel. The exploration section details these more.

## Fellowship

Fellowship represents party cohesion. If the group is happy, well rested, and ready to go, fellowship will be high. It is stepped down during stressful situations and can impact various tests negatively, particularly during trade and other social situations.
