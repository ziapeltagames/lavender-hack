# Downtime

**Downtime** begins when the characters arrive back at a comparatively safe populated locale that functions as their long term base of operations. Downtime is primarily an opportunity to turn valuables into experience, although it is also the time to research mysteries or craft items. Time during downtime is measured in **weeks**, with downtime taking at least one week, and possibly more, depending on how many weeks the players spend performing downtime actions.

## Wealth

There is a wealth table on the party sheet. This reflects the various sorts of investments and connections that the party has available to them. When downtime begins, items of known value are erased from character sheets and the values are tallied on the wealth table by filling in boxes. During downtime, the wealth table may be spent from to accomplish different actions, by spending (erasing) the boxes of the desired values.

There are five boxes on each row of the wealth table. This is to reflect the rough 5:1 ratio of the value scale (see [_Valuables_](VALUABLES.md)). When **five boxes** of a row are filled in, they may be erased, and **one box of the higher value** is filled in.

## Liquidity

It is possible to trade down on the wealth table, but the rate is worse than trading up. Flexibility costs money! **Erasing one box** on the wealth table lets a player fill in **four boxes of the lower value**.

## Spending

To **spend wealth**, simply erase the box of the given value. For example, to spend wealth 2, erase a box on the second row of the wealth table. Players may move wealth up or down as detailed above before doing so.

## Downtime Procedure

1. Bank known valuables.
   1. One week of time passes.
2. If the players wish to stay in town, they must choose one of the following downtime actions.
   1. **Train**, **craft**, **research**, **bank**, or **carouse**.
   2. One week of time passes.
   3. Repeat step 2.
3. When the players are ready to end downtime, they must pay cost of living.
   1. Set resource dice based on value of payment.
      1. Less than half of level: d4s
      2. Less than level: d6s
      3. Equal to level: d8s
      4. Higher than level: d10s

# Banking Valuables

At the start of downtime, any valuables of known value (see [_Valuables_](VALUABLES.md)) may be tallied and banked. For each valuable that is banked, it is erased from the character sheet, and one tally is marked on the appropriate row of the wealth table on the party sheet. If any row of the wealth table is completely filled with five marks, the row may be erased and one higher value tally is marked.

Items of unknown value must be **researched** first to determine their worth. Items of known value don't have to be banked, but it is the only way to remove them from a character sheet. Additionally, the only time items may be banked in bulk is at the beginning of downtime.

# Progress

Training and crafting require progress. There are progress tracks on the character sheet. Each step of a progress track has a value equal to the step number. The first box on a progress track has a value of one, the second box on a progress track has a value of two, and so on.

Making progress requires wealth. In order to fill in a progress box, a player must erase a box with the equivalent value from the wealth table. For example, a wealth of three must be spent to fill in the third progress box. The progress boxes must be tallied in order.

# Training

Training is the process of gathering experience and resources necessary for leveling up. It takes an amount of progress equal to the target level. For example, a 3rd level character needs four progress to reach level 4. Reaching level 4 would require 4 weeks of downtime, along with spending wealth of value 1, 2, 3, and 4 in that order. All of the progress doesn't need to be tallied in one session of downtime. This is particularly difficult at higher levels.

## Level Up Procedure

When the progress box equal to the target level is filled in, the character levels up. Complete the following steps.

1. The player may increase either (choose one) primary ability score by one.
2. Roll a number of hit dice equal to new level and add them together.
   1. Add Con to each roll.
   2. If the total is higher than the character's maximum hit points, use new result as maximum.
3. Note any new class abilities.

# Crafting

The mechanics of crafting are the same as training, but crafting is used to create new items rather than gain experience. The sorts of items a character may craft are restricted based on class. The Wise may craft scrolls, wands, staves. The Strong may craft arms and armor. The Deft may craft rings, bows, and clothing. See the [_MAGIC ITEMS_](ITEMS.md) section for more details.

# Research

Researching is the way to find the actual value of things, as well as the properties of magical items. For a week of research, a player needs to spend wealth 2. After spending wealth, they may ask a question about an item. Players may either determine the **value** of an item or a **magical property** of an item. A Wise character knows if an item is magical or not (see [_Wise_](WISE.md)). The gamemaster tells players when the last magical property of an item is discovered.

## Maps

TBD - Maps should be able to be converted into wealth?

## Mysteries

TBD - Information and secrets found while explorting should be able to be converted into wealth?

# Bank

Valuables may be banked later in downtime, but it takes a week of downtime, and spending 1 wealth. Still, this is the only way to bank valuables during the same downtime phase in which they were researched.

# Carouse

To initiate carousing, a player spends wealth 2 and makes a **Cha test** for their character.

* Critical: Map
* Strong: Two Rumors
* Weak: Rumor
* Miss: Nothing
* Fumble: Fight!

# Cost of Living

When the players choose to end downtime, or run out of funds with which to conduct actions, they must pay cost of living before heading out into the wilds. The cost of living is based on the character with the **highest** level in the party. The higher the level, the more accustomed to a higher standard of living! At least **1 wealth** must be spent if it is available.

## End of Downtime Resource Dice

Depending on the value spent, the four resource dice (food, fellowship, gear, and light) are set appropriately. Then the characters are ready to continue exploration!

* Nothing: d20s
* Less than half of level (round down): d4s
* Less than level: d6s
* Equal to level: d8s
* Higher than level: d10s
