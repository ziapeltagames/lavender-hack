# Downtime

**Downtime** begins when the characters arrive back at a comparatively safe populated locale that functions as their long term base of operations. Downtime is primarily an opportunity to turn valuables into experience, although it is also the time to research mysteries or craft items. Time during downtime is measured in **weeks**, with downtime taking at least one week, and possibly more, depending on how many weeks the players spend performing downtime actions.

## Downtime Procedure

1. Bank known valuables.
   1. One week of time passes.
2. If the players wish to stay in town, they must choose one of the following downtime actions.
   1. **Train**, **craft**, **research**, or **carouse**.
   2. One week of time passes.
   3. Repeat step 2.
3. When the players are ready to end downtime, they must pay cost of living.
   1. Set resource dice based on value of payment.
      1. Less than half of level: d4s
      2. Less than level: d6s
      3. Equal to level: d8s
      4. Higher than level: d10s

# Banking Known Valuables

At the start of downtime, any valuables of known value (see [_Valuables_](VALUABLES.md)) are tallied and banked. For each valuable that is banked, it is erased from the character sheet, and one tally is marked on the appropriate row of the wealth table on the party sheet. If any row of the wealth table is completely filled with five marks, the row is erased and one higher value tally is marked.

Items of unknown value must be **researched** first to determine their worth.

# Training and Crafting Progress

Training and crafting require progress. There is a progress track for training and two progress tracks for crafting on the character sheet. Each step of the progress track has a value equal to the step number. The first box on the progress track has a value of one, the second box on the progress track has a value of two, and so on.

Making progress requires wealth. In order to fill in a progress box, a player must erase a box with the equivalent value from the wealth table. For example, a wealth of three must be spent to fill in the third progress box. The progress boxes must be filled in order.

## Making Change

It is possible to trade down on the party wealth sheet, but the rate is worse than trading up. Erasing a tally on the wealth table yields **four** tallies of one lower value.

# Training

Training is the process of gathering experience and resources necessary for leveling up. It takes an amount of progress equal to the target level. For example, a 3rd level character needs four progress to reach level 4. Reaching level 4 would require 4 weeks of downtime, along with spending wealth of value 1, 2, 3, and 4. Finishing progress doesn't need to be accomplished in one session of downtime.

## Level Up Procedure

When the progress box equal to the target level is filled in, the character levels up. Complete the following steps.

1. The player may increase either (choose one) primary ability score by one.
2. Roll a number of hit dice equal to new level and add them together.
   1. Add Con to each roll.
   2. If the total is higher than the character's maximum hit points, use new result as maximum.
3. Note any new class abilities.

# Crafting

Crafting works in a similar fashion to training, but is used to create new items. The sorts of items a character may craft are restricted based on class.

DETAILS TBD: The Wise may craft scrolls, wands, staves. The Strong may craft arms and armor. The Deft may craft rings, bows, and clothing.
