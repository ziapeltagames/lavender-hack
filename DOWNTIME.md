# Downtime

**Downtime** begins when the characters arrive back at their home or at some safe populated location that is functioning as their long term base of operations. Downtime is primarily an opportunity to turn valuables into experience, although it is also the time to research mysteries or craft items. Time during downtime is measured in **weeks**, with downtime taking at least one week, and possibly more, depending on how many weeks the players spend performing downtime actions.

## Downtime Procedure

1. Bank known valuables.
   1. One week of time passes.
2. Players may choose downtime actions.
   1. **Training** in their character class, **crafting** an item, or conducting **research**.
   2. One week of time passes.
3. Pay cost of living.
   1. Set resource dice based on paid cost of living.
      1. Less than half of level: d4s
      2. Less than level: d6s
      3. Equal to level: d8s
      4. Higher than level: d10s

# Banking Known Valuables

At the start of downtime, any valuables of known value (see [_Valuables_](VALUABLES.md)) are tallied and banked. For each valuable that is banked, it is erased from the character sheet, and one tally is marked on the appropriate value row of the party wealth sheet. If any row of the party wealth table is completely filled with five marks, the row is erased and one higher value tally marked.

Values that are unknown must be **researched** first to determine their worth.

# Downtime Progress

Training and crafting require progress. There is a progress track for training and two progress tracks for crafting on the character sheet. Each step of the progress track has a value equal to the step number. The first box on the progress track has a value of one, the second box on the progress track has a value of two, and so on.

Making progress requires wealth. In order to fill in a progress box, a player must erase a box with the equivalent value from the party wealth table. The progress boxes must be filled in order. So, a wealth of one is spent to fill in the first box, a wealth of two is spent to fill in the second box.
