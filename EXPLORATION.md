# Exploration

One of the goals of _LHR_ is to work well for hexcrawls, the sorts of adventures where characters go out into the hinterlands and figure out what's where.

Each day is divided into four hour watches, for a total of six watches each day (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night). For each watch, choose one: explore, move, or rest. The procedures are slightly different if characters are in a dungeon or wilderness.

## End of Watch

* Roll food die
* Roll light die (if in dungeon)
* Check for encounters
* Dawn
    * The Wise memorize spells if they rested for two watches

## Wilderness Exploration Procedure

* Explore
    * Find something in the hex, if it's there
* Move
    * Attempt to move to an adjacent hex
    * Check for getting lost
        * Scout rolls Wis
        * If failed, lose a watch, raise the discord die, and return to where you are
* Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die and regain that many hit points
    * Repair. Spend repair cost and test to repair armor or weapon (Con), on success, improve usage die up to max
    * Memorize. Roll Int, on success, gain one spell up to max
    * Forage. Test (Wis)
        * Complete: raise the food die or find a random interesting herb from the area
        * Partial: food is found, but it is rotten or comprimised in some way
        * Failure: encounter

## Dungeon Exploration Procedure

* Explore
    * Slow, cautious, movement
    * May carefully search up to *four* medium sized rooms
        * Find something of interest in each room, if it exists
    * Gain advantage if traps are triggered
* Move
    * Move quickly without searching
        * Also for fleeing
    * May cover three times as much ground as exploration
    * Automatically surprised and disadvantage if traps are triggered
* Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die with disadvantage and regain that many hit points
    * Memorize. Roll Int with disadvantage, on success, gain one spell

# Encounter Procedure

When a **sentient being** is first discovered, apply the following procedure.

* Check for starting distance
* Check for surprise
    * Roll Dex, if passed, no surprise
* Choose one approach
    * Communicate
    * Combat
        * Roll usage dice for armor at start of combat
    * Flee
        * Enemy may make free strikes as appropriate
        * A chase ensues

# Communicate

One player may make a Cha test. If there isn't a mutually understandable language, roll with disadvantage. If the characters trade something of value to the other group or have leverage for some reason, roll with advantage. The result determines their feelings toward the party.

* Critical: Friendly
* Complete: Talkative
* Partial: Unsure
* Miss: Unfriendly
* Fumble: Hostile
