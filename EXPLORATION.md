# Exploration

Exploration is the first of four pillars that support _Lavendar Hack_, the others being encounters, factions, and downtime. One of the goals of _Lavender Hack_ is to work well for wilderness **hexcrawls**, the sorts of adventures where characters go out into the hinterlands and figure out what's where and who's what. The term hexcrawl comes from the wealth of _B/X_ content which feature maps with hexes of varying scales, wherein each hex indicates terrain of a particular type.

The goal of the exploration system is to make distances feel distant, such that resources like food are a concern, and the chance for surprise encounters with beasts and factions is always a possibility. Ocean exploration is very similar to wilderness exploration, the principal difference being a faster movement rate, very different sorts of events, and a reliance on wind speeds and direction.

Of course, dungeons and dungeon exploration are the bread and butter of _B/X_ play. Unfortunately, dungeon maps, typically rendered on grids, do not provide as clean a unit of abstraction as hexes. This creates more difficulty when trying to come up with usable measures for time and distance. It also makes for more challenges when players try to make sense of where they are.

### Blather

I tried to make the procedures for each type of exploration (wilderness, dungeon, ocean) mirror each other somewhat closely. Exploration is built around the options of **exploring** a new place, **travelling** through somewhere you've been, **searching** where you are, and **resting**. In terms of time and distance, dungeon exploration is the most zoomed in, while ocean exploration is the most zoomed out. Dungeon exploration relies mostly on light, wilderness exploration mostly on food, and ocean exploration mostly on wind.

# Time and Distance

New units of time and distance are needed to handle exploration at the right level of abstraction. The new units of time are **watches** of roughly four hours and **turns** of roughly ten minutes. The new units of distance are **hexes** of roughly three miles across and **rooms** of roughly 1,000 square feet. Watches and hexes are used primarily for wilderness exploration, while turns and rooms are used for dungeon exploration.

### Blather

The term watch comes from _Hot Springs Island_ (not sure if it came from somewhere else first), and I really like that level of abstraction for wilderness exploration. It keeps the pace moving, which is important for a game featuring resource management. The AD&D 1E encounter system was broken up into six different time periods, although that was only for encounter checks, not as a unifying way to track time.

Turns are a B/X legacy term, going all the way back to the wargaming roots of D&D. I'm not fond of the word "turn" to describe ten minutes, but it has lots of cultural inertia behind it. _Black Hack_ uses hours, minutes, and seconds to describe these zoomed in time structures, which is consistent and matches casual language. However, the fact that the terms are plural can make speech a little clunky, as in "what are you doing for these minutes".
