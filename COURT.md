# Court

The **court** procedure is used to handle social interactions with a faction. It is not used for when characters return home. That is covered under the downtime procedure.

### Blather

I struggled on what to call this procedure, but liked the word court, since it has multiple connotations, all of which feel applicable. Community was another option, but court is also a verb, which fits in better with combat, exploration, and chase. Court doesn't mean a formal medieval audience with royalty, though. The usage of court to mean "to persuade or win over" is also applicable, as court can be with any faction.

## Beginning Court

In order to begin courting a faction, the characters must be at a location the faction controls, with important characters from the faction present, and the faction must not be in such a state that they're attacking the characters on sight (the faction must have a disposition of 1 or higher). Furthermore, the characters may only court a faction **once** between each downtime procedure.

If a faction has a disposition of 0, the characters are going to need to get their foot in the door somehow, perhaps by offering a bribe of some sort or using magical abilities. There are no rules for shifting a faction from a disposition of 0 to a disposition of 1, but it shouldn't be easy.

## Procedure

1. Set fellowship die equal to max result.
2. Create goals.
3. Take actions.
    1. Purse goals.
    2. Trade.
    3. Curry favor.
4. Lower fellowship die by one. Players _may_ continue taking actions or end court. If fellowship is lowered to 1, the players must move on to step 5.
5. If the fellowship die is a 1, roll fellowship.

# Goals

Goals are written from the perspective of characters. They are things the characters want, such as "let us pass through the Eastern gate", "release Xendar from prison", or "let us view the Rotting Hand Scroll". They are not things of value, such as gear or resources. Those items are covered under trading. Write goals down on different index cards, also noting the difficulty for the goal.

## Goal Difficulties

Goals all have difficulties, which range from 3-12, representing how likely it is the faction is to do the thing. The disposition of the faction should be taken into account when setting difficulties. Goal difficulties of 1-2 aren't used both because the math doesn't work well and goals should represent things which require _some_ measure of convincing. Goals with a difficulty of 12 are going to be very, very hard to achieve, even if the party has a high fellowship die.

## Goal Progress

Progress toward a goal is tracked on the card. When a goal has an amount of progress equal to or greater than the difficulty, it is achieved. Remove the goal from play and narrate any consequences from achieving the goal.

## Starting Goals

At the start of court, write down some appropriate goals. This can and should be a collaborative effort, with all of the players contributing ideas. Goals which weren't achieved on previous visits to court may also be recycled if they're still appropriate.

# Pursue Goals

When a character is in the presence of an influential member of a faction, they may **pursue a goal** with that faction. The player chooses a goal and chooses which ability score to test based on the approach they take. The choices for approach are **rapport (Cha)**, **command (Wis)**, **intimidation (Con)**, or **logic (Int)**. The approach should color the nature of the interaction. **Test Cha / Wis / Con / Int:**

* Critical: +3 progress
* Strong: +2 progress
* Weak: +1 progress
* Miss: None
* Fumble: Incident! Lower the faction disposition by one.

If the approach used is the **favored approach** for the faction, **add one** additional progress to a goal on a success. A miss is still a miss.

## Incidents

An incident represents a social faux pas of some significant severity. If the faction has a disposition of 1 and an incident occurs, the characters are about to be imprisoned or killed. The combat and chase procedures may be appropriate now! Things are about to get out of hand.

# Trade

When a character is in the presence of someone from a faction who has the types of goods or services they want, they may offer up something of value and specify what they want in return to **make a trade** with the faction. The item on offer is removed from the character sheet. The character receives something equal or less in value (see note on maximum value below), modified by a **Cha Test:**

* Critical: +2 value
* Strong: +1 value
* Weak: +0 value
* Miss: -1 value
* Fumble: -2 value

The character may trade for **valuables**, **resources**, or **rumors** the faction would reasonably be able to provide. Remember to modify valuables appropriately based on what the faction supplies or demands.

For resources, the die type gained is equal to twice the value (see [Valuables](VALUABLES.md), with a max die type of d12. For example, a value 5 sets the die to a d10. If the fellowship die is improved, swap out the die type, but don't change the top facing number, since that tracks turns. Gaining fellowship resources represents carousing and revelry.

Rumors traded for are given a rough worth equal to how common the knowledge is. This is going to be very coarse, but value one rumors are fairly common knowledge like "where's an inn", while value ten rumors might be "the true name to bind Ungrax, lord of demons".

## Maximum Value

The **maximum value** that can be gained from a faction is equal to their **disposition**. Anything above that is wasted. Hostile forces don't set you up with premium gear.

## Trading Down

As mentioned in [Valuables](VALUABLES.md), when trading for valuables, a character may take five slots worth of something one lower in value.

## Example

Wendy is playing _Yargrel the Crafty_ and the fellowship die is currently a d6. The party is visiting the centaurs of North Hollow (disposition 5), and she offers up wyvern poison (value 4) for food, drink, and good conversation (gaining a better fellowship die). The centaurs demand wyvern poison, so the value is increased to 5. The Cha test results in a natural 20! Critical! The final value is now a 7.

However, the max value is a 5 because the centaur disposition is a 5. So, the fellowship die is swapped out for a d10 (twice the result). Even if the disposition with the centaurs had been higher, only a value 6 could have been used, because the d12 is the highest resource die. Still much better than a d6!

### Blather

The Centaurs Demand Wyvern Poison is also the name of my stoner rock filk band.

# Curry Favor

When a character is in the presence of an influential member of a faction, and they have satisfied one of the factions wants, they may **curry favor** with that faction. Increase the disposition of the faction by one.
