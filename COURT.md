# Court

The **court** procedure is used to handle social interactions with a faction. It is not used for when characters return home. That is covered under the downtime procedure.

### Blather

I struggled on what to call this procedure, but liked the word court, since it has multiple connotations, all of which feel applicable. Community was another option, but court is also a verb, which fits in better with combat, exploration, and chase. Court doesn't mean a formal medieval audience with royalty, though. The usage of court to mean "to persuade or win over" is also applicable, as court can be with any faction.

## Beginning Court

In order to begin courting a faction, the characters must be at a location the faction controls, with important characters from the faction present, and the faction must not be in such a state that they're attacking the characters on sight (the faction must have a disposition of 1 or higher). Furthermore, the characters may only court a faction **once** between each downtime procedure.

If a faction has a disposition of 0, the characters are going to need to get their foot in the door somehow, perhaps by offering a bribe of some sort or using magical abilities. There are no rules for shifting a faction from a disposition of 0 to a disposition of 1, but it shouldn't be easy.

## Procedure

1. Set fellowship die equal to max result.
2. Create goals.
3. Take actions.
    1. Purse Goals.
    2. Curry favor.
    3. Trade.
    4. Create advantage.
4. Lower fellowship die by one. Players _may_ continue taking actions or end court. If fellowship is lowered to 1, the players must move on to step 5.
5. If the fellowship die is a 1, roll fellowship.

# Goals

Goals are written from the perspective of characters. They are things the characters want, such as "let us pass through the Eastern gate", "release Xendar from prison", or "let us view the Rotting Hand Scroll". They are not things of value, such as gear or resources. Those items are covered under trading.

## Goal Difficulties

Goals all have difficulties, which range from 1-10, representing how likely it is the faction is to do the thing. The disposition of the faction should be taken into account when setting difficulties. Goals with a difficulty of 10 are going to be very, very hard, even if the party has a high fellowship die.

## Starting Goals

At the start of court, write down some appropriate goals. This can and should be a collaborative effort, with all of the players contributing ideas. Goals which weren't achieved on previous visits to court may also be recycled if they're still appropriate.
