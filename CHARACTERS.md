# Characters

_LHC_ uses four classes, each of which is a broad archetype: **Strong**, **Wise**, **Deft**, and **Weird**. The classes map roughly to the B/X idea of warriors, spellcasters, rogues, and weird... doesn't map. The classes also have favored abilities: Strong use Strength and Constitution, Wise use Intelligence and Wisdom, Deft use Dexterity and Charisma, and Weird are... weird.

### Blather

Those class names are from _Whitehack_. Still undecided on going that route rather than the more standard class names.

## Backgrounds and Connections

Each character has a background which helps to define them. If the background is relevant to a test, the player may gain advantage on the test roll. However, utilizing a background potentially requires the right gear, so if the result is a partial success, the resource die must be rolled (again if partial success already requires a resource roll).

Suggestion: Can use occupations from _Into the Odd_ page 36 or from _Dungeon Crawl Classics_ page 22. Then roll a connection (player to your left) from _Into the Odd_ page 37.

To-do: Create some tables to flesh out relationships and traits. Maybe this is on a per class basis?

### Blather

This is a substitute for a skill system. It's useful to create a focused and interesting background, which isn't an easy skill to develop. If a background is too broad it can feel watered down, but if it's hyper focused, it may never feel applicable.
