# Characters

_Lavender Hack_ uses four classes, each of which is a broad archetype: **Strong**, **Wise**, **Deft**, and **Weird**. The classes map roughly to the B/X idea of warriors, spellcasters, rogues, and weird... doesn't map. The classes also have favored abilities: Strong use Strength and Constitution, Wise use Intelligence and Wisdom, Deft use Dexterity and Charisma, and Weird are... weird.

### Blather

Those class names are from _Whitehack_. Still undecided on going that route rather than the more standard class names.

## Backgrounds and Connections

Each character has a background which helps to define them. If the background is relevant to a test, the player may gain advantage on the test roll. However, utilizing a background potentially requires the right gear, so if the result is a partial success, the resource die must be rolled (again if partial success already requires a resource roll).

Suggestion: Can use occupations from _Into the Odd_ page 36 or from _Dungeon Crawl Classics_ page 22. Then roll a connection (player to your left) from _Into the Odd_ page 37.

To-do: Create some tables to flesh out relationships and traits. Maybe this is on a per class basis?

### Blather

This is a substitute for a skill system. It's useful to create a focused and interesting background, which isn't an easy skill to develop. If a background is too broad it can feel watered down, but if it's hyper focused, it may never feel applicable.

## Character Creation

* Roll 3d6 in order for Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution, and Charisma
    * Record ability modifiers
* Roll or create a background
* Choose a class (Strong, Wise, Deft, Weird)
* Roll hit points using class hit die
    * Roll with advantage and add Con
* Roll d6 for starting gear
    * Starting slots are 5+Str
* Record starting class abilities

## Primary Abilities and the Gear Die

Classes may roll the gear die for any test that uses their primary abilities. This may be done after the test roll, as long as the test roll is not a fumble or a critical. Those results can't be modified. As usual, if the gear die roll is a 1-3, it is stepped down.

# The Weird

The weird is an experimental class still in progress. It does not have its own section yet.

* HP: d6
* Primary: None
* Armor: None
* Weapons: Any

## Features

**Weirdness**: The Weird, naturally, have weirdness. Choose two first level weirdness during character creation. At each new level, gain one weirdness equal to level attained.

* Level 1) Nibbler, 2) Swap
* Level 2) Beastfriend, 2) Weight

**Fatigue**: The Weird use a fatigue usage die. It is rolled each time weirdness is used. Frequently weirdness uses the result of the fatigue die. When it is gone, no more weirdness may be used. After a **full rest**, it is reset to a d8.

## Gear Die

The Weird can't use the gear die.

## Starting Equipment

1. Willow Wand
2. Robe of Shimmer
