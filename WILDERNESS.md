# Wilderness Exploration

**Wilderness exploration** begins when the characters arrive at a remote area they wish to explore that has a corresponding **hex map** of terrain and important sites. At least one **encounter** table is also necessary to determine what beasts and factions may be found in each sort of terrain.

The gamemaster determines where the players are located on the hex map. If this is after **downtime**, reset all resources to d8.

## Watches and Hexes

Time during wilderness exploration is divided into **four hour watches**, for a total of six watches each day (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night). Using a stack of different colored poker chips is an effective way to track this (red, yellow, yellow, red, black, black). Watches are tracked during wilderness exploration and dungeon exploration.

The standard hex is assumed to be three miles across and populated with terrain that is difficult to negotiate (mountains, jungle, woods). Hexes of different sizes will require slight modifications to this procedure.

## Wilderness Exploration Procedure

1. At the start of a new day, determine **wilderness events**.
2. Spotlight player chooses one of the following actions for the group.
    1. **Explore** a new hex, **travel** through an already explored hex, or **search** the current hex.
        1. Takes one or two watches, depending on encumbrance.
    4. **Regroup** and **rebalance gear**.
        1. One watch.
    5. **Camp**.
        1. Two watches.
4. One watch passes.
    1. If six watches have passed, mark another day of time and reset the watches.
    2. On the first (dawn) and fourth (dusk) watch, **roll the food die**.

# Wilderness Events

To determine **wilderness events**, the gamemaster makes a general test, and rolls on the subtable indicated, if necessary.

* Critical: Lair.
* Strong: Bad Weather.
* Weak: Encounter.
* Miss: None.
* Fumble: Discovery.

## Bad Weather

The bad weather result indicates bad weather appropriate for the type of terrain and season, such as a torrential downpour, a blizzard, or a dust storm. Bad weather lasts the entire day and makes outdoor activities much more difficult. Any rolls related to scouting, hunting, camping, and foraging are **made with disadvantage on a day with bad weather**.

## Encounter

The encounter result indicates an encounter with creatures or factions native to the area. **Roll a d6** to determine the watch when the encounter will occur (dawn, day, day, dusk, night, night).

Most published products have encounter tables for each region the players may find themselves in. If they don't, it will be necessary to create one. It's useful if encounter tables aren't just a list of vicious monsters, but rather should include factions as well as less dangerous fauna that may be hunted or tracked.

Interactions with factions provide opportunities for trade and role-playing. If an encounter is indicated, use the **encounter procedure** to determine how the beasts or factions react to the characters. Every encounter shouldn't default to combat.

## Lair

In the case of a lair result, use the standard encounter tables, but instead of a roaming group, the beasts or faction are encountered in their lair. There are typically many more creatures in their lair then are found roaming. There also may be an opportunity for more treasure. If a hex already has a lair indicated, use that rather than creating a new one. The lair will be found in the next hex the party enters.

## Discovery

If the party has a discovery, they have found a resource they can use in the hex. Make a general test, consulting the table below. The discovery will be found in the next hex the party enters. Alternatively, if the hex already has something of value that could be discovered, that is now found, without needing to search for it.

* Critical: Fellowship.
    * An area of extreme beauty, rare spices, pipe weed.
* Strong: Light.
    * Discarded lantern oil, plants useful for making torches.
* Weak: Gear.
    * A cache of equipment, medicinal plants.
* Miss: Food.
    * Berries, squash, an abundance of fish.

Step up the indicated resource die (as usual, can never be higher than a d12). The nature of what is found should be appropriate to the type of die.

### Blather

The standard OSR way to handle encounters is to roll a die once for every unit of time (such as every watch), with the odds based on the sort of terrain the characters find themselves in. I prefer rolling less frequently, but having the odds for something happening be higher. That prevents the chance for a series of encounters back to back to back, which can start to feel a little tedious. Particularly if it's always monsters. However, it increases the chance that something is happening each day, which can make the world feel alive. I also like trying to include elements like weather and discoveries into the roll, hence using the word events rather than encounters.

I'm debating adding something like a spotlight system on a miss result. The spotlight would be a reminder to ask a player questions about their character, and make sure that more quiet players have the spotlight (if they want it). There may also be a mechanical benefit to being in the spotlight, such as gaining advantage on certain rolls. I like the idea of having something like that included in events.

# Exploration and Travel

**Exploration** is moving to a new hex the characters haven't been to before. Since it is a new hex, there is a chance the characters get lost. One character is nominated as a **scout**. The player of the scouting character makes a **Wis test**. On a success, the characters arrive at the desired hex, as normal. Remember that bad weather requires this roll be made with disadvantage!

On a failure, they have temporarily become lost, and end up in a random hex. The scout player should roll a d6. On a 1-4, the characters end up back where they started. On a 5, they veer left, ending up in the hex left of where they desired. On a 6, they veer right, ending up in the hex to the right of where they desired. In each case, the target hex remains unexplored, but the characters know where they are after the watch.

When characters **travel** through hexes they have already visited, they may move through two hexes in one watch. Scout checks are not needed.

## Blather

In the old AD&D 1E game, there was an involved procedure for becoming lost, whereby the GM secretly tracked where characters were, and players kind of fumbled about in the dark. I found it more fun in principal than in practice. Here, becoming lost primarily sacrifices time.

## Encumbrance

If one or more characters in the party are encumbered, it takes **two watches to explore** and only **one hex may be traveled** through each turn.

# Search

If there is something of interest in the hex, it is found. This is commonly used to find lairs or entrances to dungeons. If there are multiple things of interest, only one is found for each watch spent searching.

## Blather

I really like the _Hot Springs Island_ approach, where each hex has three things of interest that may be searched for. Giving players some knowledge of where and when to search makes it a more useful action to take.

# Regroup

Regrouping allows characters to individually choose from a variety of actions during the watch. Each player may choose a different action from the following list.

* Heal.
* Repair.
* Memorize.
* Forage.

Additionally, as part of regrouping, players may **rebalance gear**. This is down by stepping down the fellowship die, and setting the gear die to a d6.

## Heal

In a long rest, a player may roll their hit die and recover that many hit points.

## Repair

A character may repair a damaged weapon or armor. If the gear die is of a higher type than the damaged weapon or armor die, the player rolls the gear die and steps up a damaged weapon or armor die one step.

## Memorize Working

A player may memorize one working for their character if they have slots available.

## Forage

The player makes a **Wis test** and applies the results as follows. Foraging is used broadly here, and includes hunting animals, setting traps, and identifying edible plants.

* Critical: Step up the food die.
* Strong: All food die rolls for the rest of the day automatically pass. 
* Weak: The next food die roll automatically passes.
* Miss: Nothing happens.
* Fumble: Encounter.

Encounters while foraging may be particularly dangerous if the character is out alone! Better hope it's a friendly faction. Depending on the result, this may represent the hunter becoming the hunted.

# Camp

Camping lasts two watches. After camping, wise characters may recover all workings. Additionally, each character may roll their hit die and regain that many hit points. If there is bad weather, the recovery roll is made with disadvantage (roll hit die twice and choose lower result).

# Actions at Night

Players must roll the light die with disadvantage for each night watch they perform any actions other than camping.
