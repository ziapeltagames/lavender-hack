# Combat Procedure

Combat is divided up into rounds, which use the following procedure.

* Declare Actions
    * Melee / Missile / Spell
* Check Initiative (Dex Test)
    * If passed, character is quick, otherwise they are slow
* Quick Actions
* Enemy Actions
    * Slow characters using missile or spells may be interrupted if damaged
    * Players roll to defend, although the GM rolls for monster damage or effects
* Slow Actions
* Morale Check
    * Single Enemy: First hit, 1/2 hp lost, 3/4 hp lost
    * Group: First casualty, 1/2 dead, 3/4 dead

Actions are chosen from the list below. In general, movement is possible in addition to an action. This list of actions is not exhaustive - using items (potions, rings, scrolls, wands) and other special abilities may qualify.

## Armor

Armor dice are **rolled as needed** (don't roll armor dice at the start of combat). Once rolled, the value may decrease during the combat procedure as blows are taken. Enemies do not roll for armor - they have fixed value listed in the stat block.

## Melee

Test Strength.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Strong: Bypass armor
* Weak: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Exertion (lower armor die value, to a minimum of one)
   * Exposed position
* Miss: Miss
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Missile

Test Dexterity.

* Critical: Double damage and bypass armor
* Strong: Bypass armor
* Weak: Choose one
   * Body blow (subtract opponent's armor from damage roll)
   * Ammo check (ammunition usage)
   * Exposed position
* Miss: Miss
* Fumble: Weapon effectiveness degrades one die

## Defend

Used whenever an enemy makes a physically damaging attack. This is a player facing game, so the player rolls. Test Constitution.

* Critical: No damage and next attack against enemy gains advantage
* Strong: No damage
* Weak: Subtract armor from damage, then lower armor die by one
    * Armor may not lower below a 1
* Miss: Full damage
* Fumble: Enemy does double damage

## Spell

Test Int

* Critical: Double effect and keep spell
* Strong: Effect and keep spell
* Weak: Effect and lose spell
* Miss: No effect and lose spell
* Fumble: Magical mishap

## After Combat

Any armor dice showing a 1 must make a usage test using the die. A failure degrades the armor one step. Note the damaged value of the armor in the equipment section.
