Fellowship
Disposition
Boons

Somehow fellowship should set a tolerance of some sort, which determines how long until

When a culture is indifferent or friendly to the party, and a character has a valuable they wish to part with, the party may engage in a *trade*. Roll Cha.

* Critical: +2 Value
* Complete: +1 Value
* Partial: +0 Value
* Miss: -1 Value
* Fumble: -2 Value

Add the result to the value of the item traded. The following choices are then available: 

**Trade Goods**: Receive goods that the culture has of a value less than or equal to the result.

**Buy Gear**: If the value is higher than the resource die value, it is raised by one.

**Carouse**: If the value is at least one, the discord die may be lowered by one. If the value is higher than the discord die, it is lowered by two.

## Supply and Demand

Different cultures have very different ideas of value, whether driven by preference or scarcity. If a culture **supplies** a certain type of valuable (such as potions), its value is one less in interactions with them. If a culture **demands** a certain type of valuable, its value is worth one more in interactions with them. Naturally, it's worth giving a culture what they demand and getting what a culture supplies! That's trading 101!

Home doesn't have this restriction - it works differently.
