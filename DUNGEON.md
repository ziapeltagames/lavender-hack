# Dungeon Exploration

**Dungeon exploration** begins when the characters arrive in a dungeon they wish to explore that has a corresponding numbered **grid map** of rooms, passages, doorways, and important features. At least one **encounter** table is also necessary to determine what sorts of beasts and factions may be found in the dungeon.

## Turns and Rooms

During dungeon exploration, time is measured in **turns** of roughly ten minutes. Using a stack of six different colored poker chips is an effective way to track an hour of time (red, black, black, red, black, black). This is similar to the six watches in a day for wilderness exploration, except the first and fourth turns track light instead of food.

Additionally, three tokens or poker chips are needed to track the passing of hours. Each time six turns pass, one hour goes by. Track this by placing one poker chip in the hours stack. After the fourth hour, reset the hour tracking and move time forward one watch. Dungeon exploration doesn't typically last much longer than a watch or two, since it tends to deplete resources much quicker than wilderness exploration.

Distance in the dungeon is tracked via **rooms of roughly 1,000 square feet**. This requires some hand waving to use effectively. A long hallway may need to be broken up into multiple rooms, while a set of very small rooms would be considered one room for purposes of exploration time. In most published adventures, any keyed area with a number or a name is probably one room. The important thing is to be aggressive with keeping time moving.

## Dungeon Exploration Procedure

1. At the start of a new hour, determine **dungeon events**.
2. Spotlight player chooses one of the following actions.
    1. **Explore** a new room, **travel** through already explored rooms, or **search** the current room.
        1. One or two turns, depending on encumbrance.
    2. **Short rest**.
        1. One hour.
    3. **Camp** in the dungeon.
        1. Two watches.
3. Track time for the chosen action.
    1. On the first and fourth turn, **roll the light die**.
    2. On each hour, **roll the fellowship die**.
    3. On the first and fourth watch, **roll the food die**.

# Dungeon Events

To determine **dungeon events**, the gamemaster makes a general test, and rolls on the subtable indicated, if necessary.

* Critical: Surprise!
* Strong: Close Encounter.
* Weak: Distant Encounter.
* Miss: None.
* Fumble: Discovery.

## Encounter

Most events in the dungeon are encounters. Each dungeon or section of dungeon will need an encounter table stocked with creatures and factions that may be in the area. Another fun addition to dungeon encounter tables are rival adventuring parties. **Roll a d6** to determine the turn when the encounter will occur.

For **distant** encounters, the characters have plenty of warning before the encounter occurs. The target of the encounter is a few rooms away, and the characters hear them approaching. This is the most common result on the table. It's a way to let the players choose how to handle a coming threat: run away, try to create a barrier, ambush them. It makes for difficult choices if the threat is coming from the direction the players were intending to go.

If there's a **close** encounter, there's no time to react. The creatures have stumbled into the room. The **encounter procedure** should be used to determine how to handle this. In the **surprise** encounter, the creatures or factions were lying in wait for the characters. It's time to fight on.

For all of the encounter results, the situation at hand should be considered. If the characters have holed up in a room and spiked the doors shut, there probably isn't going to be a surprise encounter in the room. But a surprise encounter may indicate creatures that are interested in getting through the door if possible.

## Discovery

TBD

### Blather

Rather high encounter rate?

# Dungeon Movement

* Cautious or quick?
* Move
    * Move quickly without searching
        * Also for fleeing
    * May cover three times as much ground as exploration
    * Automatically surprised and disadvantage if traps are triggered

# Explore Room

* Explore
    * Slow, cautious, movement
    * May carefully search up to *four* medium sized rooms
        * Find something of interest in each room, if it exists
    * Gain advantage if traps are triggered

# Short Rest

* Short Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Roll food die.
    * Heal. Roll hit die with disadvantage and regain that many hit points
    * Memorize. Roll Int with disadvantage, on success, gain one spell
