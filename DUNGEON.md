# Dungeon Exploration

## Turns and Rooms

During dungeon exploration, time is measured in **twenty minute dungeon turns**, for a total of twelve turns each watch. Poker chips or some other counter should be used to track dungeon turns. These counters should be set up in four stacks (or piles) of three to track each **hour**.

### Blather

Turns come from _B/X_. I'm not a huge fan of that term, because it's overloaded (players basically have turns during every procedure), but it's in fairly common usage.

## Beginning Dungeon Exploration

## Dungeon Exploration Procedure

1. If an hour has passed, roll the light die.
2. If a watch has passed, roll the gear die.
2. If it is dawn, determine **events**.
    1. The gamemaster rolls a d6 to determine when the **events** occur.
    2. Then the gamemaster rolls on **events table**.
    3. These rolls should be kept secret.
3. Players choose one of the following actions:
    1. Dungeon movement.
    2. Explore area.
    3. Short Rest.
    4. Make camp.
4. One dungeon turn passes.

# Dungeon Movement

* Cautious or quick?
* Move
    * Move quickly without searching
        * Also for fleeing
    * May cover three times as much ground as exploration
    * Automatically surprised and disadvantage if traps are triggered

# Explore Room

* Explore
    * Slow, cautious, movement
    * May carefully search up to *four* medium sized rooms
        * Find something of interest in each room, if it exists
    * Gain advantage if traps are triggered

# Short Rest

* Short Rest (Each character may choose one)
    * Heal. Roll hit die with disadvantage and regain that many hit points
    * Memorize. Roll Int with disadvantage, on success, gain one spell
